Andrew Stewart Wood, of Havant, Hampshire, was accused of urinating into the ice machine at the Hard Rock Hotel in the Universal theme park resort in the early hours of Tuesday. A guest reportedly told a security guard at the luxury hotel that there was a very intoxicated man on the premises. Andrew Wood, 41, from the UK, was arrested at Orlando's Hard Rock Hotel after being caught urinating in an ice machine while intoxicated . The guard located Wood and saw him urinating into an ice machine. When he tried to stop him, Wood became belligerent, began shouting and would not cooperate. According to the police report, the security guard tried to have the guest identify himself and tell him what room he was staying in but he continued disturbing the peace and quiet of other guests. The security guard then called the police. Police removed Wood from the premises after he refused to stay in his room. Officers said that Wood was extremely intoxicated 'with the odor of alcohol emanating from his person and having random outbursts'. He was arrested on disorderly conduct charges and placed in jail where he continued to act out. Wood posted $1,000 bond and was released from Orange County Jail on Tuesday afternoon, according to a booking report. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando said: 'The health and safety of our guests is our top priority and we have removed the ice machine from service.' The hotel was unable to confirm if Wood was still a guest, adding: 'For security reasons, we are unable to provide guest information.' A standard room at the hotel costs around $294 per night.

To do that, they will go to any lengths necessary, including -- they say -- taking on ISIS. ""We all are prepared to go and destroy ISIS totally,"" one Basij commander told CNN. ""If our Imam, our Supreme Leader orders us, we will destroy ISIS."" The commander says that, so far, the Basij has not been caught up in the fight against the feared Islamic extremists currently waging war in parts of Iraq and Syria. But Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, led by General Qassem Suleimani, is already training, advising and supporting Iraqi Shia militias in their fight against ISIS. Suleimani was accused of involvement in the Shia insurgency against U.S. forces during the Iraq war. Today he is a celebrity to many Iraqis and Iranians. That is symbolic of the gulf that still exists between Iran and the U.S., regardless of any thaw in relations in the wake of the recent agreement on a framework nuclear deal and ongoing talks. Iran, militias' involvement in ISIS fight a mixed blessing . Iranian officials, who believe their strategy is making a difference in the fight against ISIS, say they would like better cooperation with the U.S., but point out that the level of trust simply isn't there. ""At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,"" said General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, commander of Iran's ground forces. ""We would like the US to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in U.S. military leadership."" And the feeling is mutual: the U.S., which is leading the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq, has denied any direct coordination with Iran. Iran will do what it takes to fight ISIS . Iranians believe air strikes against ISIS are not effective, and feel that the U.S. and its allies are not trying seriously enough to defeat the group. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last September that ""the aerial bombardment campaign is mostly ... a form of theater, rather than a serious battle against terrorism."" ""The battle in Iraq is very important to Iran,"" explained Mohammed Marandi, a professor at Tehran University. ""The Iranians believe that the Americans, if they wanted to, could do a lot more to put pressure on their allies. And also, if they were serious about air strikes, they could do a lot more."" It's a point the U.S., of course, disagrees with -- U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to ""degrade and ultimately defeat"" the terror group. But Iran remains unconvinced. ""If they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,"" said Major-General Hassan Firouzabadi, Iran's chief of general staff. ""The U.S. military and intelligence organizations have many ways to strike at ISIS, but we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain,"" he said. ""We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS."" In ISIS, Iran and the U.S. share a common enemy, but -- for now at least -- no apparent common strategy.Will Iran-Saudi proxy war erupt?",162,39,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"The United States government is willing to fight against ISIS.

But 10 years on from the sunny April day that saw Camilla Parker-Bowles become the Duchess of Cornwall, things are looking very different for the 67-year-old royal. Indeed, so popular has Camilla become, a recent poll revealed that not only is the Duchess loved by 50 per cent of Britons, 56 per cent credit her with Charles' own increasing popularity. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since marrying Camilla . Still in love: An intimate photo released today to mark their 10th wedding anniversary . More to the point, she has also become a much-loved member of the Royal Family, adored by her step-sons William and Harry and noticeably close to her mother-in-law, the Queen. That her relationship with the rest of the Firm is so good is due, in no small part, to her 'charm and charisma', both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with CNN. The natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the Royal Family, with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public. Most recently, she pulled off a tour of the US with aplomb, charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home. Her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month's Cheltenham Festival where, accosted by ex-glamour model Katie Price in the paddock, she posed obligingly for a selfie. A few minutes later, she was seen engrossed in conversation with author Jilly Cooper, who memorably based the caddish Rupert Campbell-Black, the star of the much-loved Rutshire Chronicles, on Camilla's ex-husband Andrew Parker-Bowles. Sharing a joke: Camilla and Prince William share a joke at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games . Natural warmth: Camilla's success is due to her charm - on display here during last month's Cheltenham . Involved: Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at the 2011 Royal Wedding . 'She is warm, smiley and sincere,' reveals one Royal insider. 'If you were going to use five words to describe her, they would be funny, down-to-earth, opinionated, family-orientated and hearty.' But Camilla's new-found confidence is hard-won. A salt-of-the-earth countrywoman who, given the opportunity, would happily go make-up free and avoid set-piece events, taking on the very public life of a senior royal hasn't been easy. That she has managed it, apparently without breaking a sweat, hasn't gone unnoticed - not least by Prince Charles himself. 'You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,' said the prince in the same CNN interview, adding: 'But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things . insiders say the transformation is less about careful PR work and more about Camilla herself - in particular, the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart. One of the first to benefit was the National Osteoporosis Society, with whom the Duchess has been involved for more than 19 years. 'Throughout our association with the Duchess, she has been unwavering in her support,' says Chief Executive Claire Severgnini. 'She is personable, knowledgeable and compassionate.' All smiles: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a chat with the Duchess of Cambridge during the 2012 Jubilee . All together: The Duchess of Cornwall in the family photo released after Prince George's christening . Close: The Duchess of Cornwall now enjoys a close relationship with the Queen . Approval: A clear sign of approval is the regularity with which the Duchess appears alongside the Queen . Shared interests: Both Camilla and the Queen share a passion for all things equestrian . Her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the Duchess. In 1994, aged 47, she was forced to watch as her 'beloved Mama' Rosalind Shand died, slowly and in agony, as a result of the disease. Indeed, the Camilla's association with the charity pre-dates her marriage, with the Duchess first getting involved while still Mrs Parker-Bowles. Asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy, biographer Penny Junor writes that she was initially reluctant, fearing she might do more harm than good, before agreeing to get involved. Although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by Princess Diana's tragic death, she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events. She has also made a name for herself as a champion of women's rights, becoming deeply involved in the UK's rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women's refuge part of every international tour. While visiting Colombian capital Bogota last November, she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center. Having a laugh: Camilla, Harry and Kate share a joke on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in June 2013 . Friendly: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a friendly relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge . All smiles: The pair were frequently spotted together during the London 2012 Olympic Games . In Washington last month, the Duchess left Prince Charles to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the District of Colombia's Sexual Assault Response Team. Camilla's increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears, with the frumpy get-ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still-trim waist. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she's never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five-strand pearl chokers. In the country, she likes tailored tweed suits by Roy Allen, one of her favourite couturiers, cosy coats by Swiss label Moncler and flattering hats by London-based milliner, Lock & Co. But as the Duchess of Cornwall prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, it is the sea-change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling. Mirror image: The two also share a similar sense of style - including a penchant for nude pumps . Cheers! Meanwhile Camilla's relationship with Prince Charles has gone from strength to strength . Charm: The Prince spoke glowingly of his wife's 'charm and charisma' in an interview last month . Not only is she close to the Queen, who was once reported as wishing she 'would just go away', Camilla is also adored by Diana's sons William and Harry - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of September's Invictus Games made only too clear. 'Having initially loathed her, the Queen gets on well with Camilla now,' adds the insider. 'She isn't as close to the Queen as Sophie [Countess of Wessex] is but that is partly because the Queen's relationship with Charles is a bit complicated anyway.' What certainly isn't complicated is Camilla's relationship with Charles. Despite such quirks as maintaining separate country homes, after 10 years, the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever. Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an ""Enid Blyton sort of Childhood"",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help ‚ help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fte. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.",115,211,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","london, british, uk, britain, royal, prince, william, harry, england, princess,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, British royal family, second in line to the throne, the royal couple","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, the British royal family, the second in line to the throne, and the royal couple.","The Duchess of Cornwall was initially disliked by the British press and British people.

4,3HPZF4IVNOVMB7OF7NSN3DENZYUYCM,b83886e4f8d257524130d105337ec7f10d865a3f,"Fruit juices made from so-called superfoods such as cranberries and pomegranates often have more sugar than a can of cola, officials have warned. While the drinks are said to have health benefits, some brands contain more than a day's recommended intake of sugar in a single 300ml serving. The Local Government Association, which represents councils that are responsible for public health, accused soft drink firms of 'dragging their heels' when it comes to minimising sugar in their products. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink (pictured left) was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, which is more than the amount in a can of Coca-Cola (right) It said children under the age of ten get almost a fifth of their sugar intake from soft drinks. In a survey, the organisation found that some cans of fizzy drinks contain almost twice the recommended daily sugar limit for adults. Even some fruit juices contain more than a single day's limit in a single serving ‚ surpassing a can of Coca-Cola. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, while PomeGreat 'Super Juice' had 12.1g. Both exceed the 10.6g per 100ml in a can of Coca-Cola ‚ but do not come close to the 15.1g per 100ml in Old Jamaica Ginger Beer. A 300ml serving of any of the four drinks would breach the 25g daily sugar limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. Juice businesses insisted the study is misleading because it does not differentiate between unhealthy added sugar ‚ such as monosaccharides and disaccharides in fizzy drinks ‚ and natural sugar found in fruit. Cranberry juice is frequently promoted as a health product which is said to ward off urinary tract infections. And pomegranate juice has been linked to resistance to prostate cancer and heart disease. The LGA is calling for a fifth of the VAT raised on sugary drinks, sweets and takeaway food to go to councils to pay for public health schemes. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, Tory leader of Warwickshire county council and chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: 'It is wholly unacceptable for one normal-sized can of soft drink to contain double the recommended daily limit. 'Products like these are fuelling the obesity crisis and helping wean a generation of overweight children. 'We are calling on the sector as a whole to step up and show more corporate responsibility.' A spokesman for Ocean Spray said cranberries are naturally low in sugar, so sweetening is required. Vitamin Water is promoted for its health benefits, but drinks contain four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml . She added: 'We offer consumers a range of reduced sugar options including our Cranberry Classic Light product . 'We've made and continue to maintain a firm commitment to low-sugar innovation, and through product formulation, price promotion and portion sizes we seek to offer the best choice in flavours, calories and formats.' Adam Pritchard, chief executive of PomeGreat, accused the LGA of distributing misleading research. He said his product does not include refined sugar, which the WHO says is more harmful than naturally occurring fruit sugars. PomeGreat instead includes pinitol, a natural compound which stops blood sugar levels rapidly rising. Mr Pritchard said: 'To lump us in with big fizzy drinks companies is just misleading. 'We are a small company competing with huge multinational businesses which are just chucking sugar into drinks because it is cheap. 'We use a much more healthy natural sweetener which costs 2.5 as much as refined sugar. It is not the same thing.'",48,89,"food, restaurant, eat, eating, babies, meal, drinks, fruit, breakfast, chicken,","weight, pounds, fat, diet, body, sugar, healthy, lose, lost, loss,","eating food at a restaurant, a healthy meal, ordering something to drink, serving breakfast, fruits are a healthy food, eating chicken","weight loss, lost weight following a diet, body fat, blood sugar levels, healthy diet, lose a few pounds of weight","This topic is about eating food at a restaurant, ordering something to drink and serving breakfast, as well as eating chicken, and fruits which are a healthy food.",This topic is about weight loss and following a healthy diet in order to regulate body fat and blood sugar levels and lose a few pounds of weight following a diet.,"It has been alleged that fruit juices are actually more unhealthy than soda.

Rojo went away during a week off for his club side, pictured with team-mate Angel di Maria on the plane, after United's 3-1 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. The Argentina international is impressing in defence under Louis van Gaal in his first season in the Premier League, though it his time off the field in Manchester that has recently come into question.

Fitness instructor Sarah Watson, 34, claims Rojo and his advisors tried to frame her for blackmail after she enjoyed a brief liaison with the United star following a night out. Rojo's identity in the case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. She said: 'He came over to me and sat down. His English was quite bad but he was chatty and said nice things to me about how I looked and how he liked my Versace dress. 'He said ""You're gorgeous, you're the best looking girl in here."" It was all very cheesy, but he's so good looking that I gave him my number.' Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. ""My love, where are you?"" he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's ‚ known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit ‚ made a shocking proposition. 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. The Argentine defender was in action for Manchester United against Aston Villa on Saturday . Rojo celebrates with team-mate Di Maria after the 3-1 victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League . Watson says that the 25-year-old offered her money to spend the night with him - which she declined - and then accepted a £30,000 offer from a newspaper to sell her story. She never received that money, and Sarah then says Rojo's representatives tried to entrap her with promises of cash to spin the story. Watson said: '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment. Watching from the stands as Rojo impressed at Old Trafford against Tim Sherwood's side at the weekend, was his wife Eugenia Lusardo, a lingerie model based in Lisbon, and their young daughter, Morena.

The 63-year-old neurosurgeon - who is believed to be preparing for a Republican presidential nomination next year - allegedly made the comments while watching the address with his chief advisor Armstrong Williams. Williams had remarked that Obama looked 'elegant' on the night. To which Carson replied: 'Like most psychopaths. That's why they're successful. That's the way they look. They all look great.' Scroll down for video . Ben Carson (left) called Obama a well-dressed 'psychopath' as he gave the State of the Union address . Carson's comments were reported by GQ in an article which added that 'casually branding the president a psychopath is exactly the sort of talk that strikes a chord‚îand just the thing that has made Carson a sensation in the GOP.' Later in the conversation, Carson had apparently exclaimed that Obama sold Americans 'a lie'. He reportedly said: 'He's trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He's sitting there saying, 'These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.'' And it's not the first time Carson has courted controversy with his critical comments of the president since he entered politics two years ago. After Carson's advisor said the President (pictured) looked 'elegant' delivering the address, Carson reportedly responded: 'Like most psychopaths. That's why they're successful' He has previously said that Obamacare is 'the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery'. Earlier this month, he argued that homosexuality is a choice because some people enter prison straight and leave gay. And last month, Carson told the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. that the Democrats now see African-Americans' support as an entitlement and choose to 'keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.'

But when it comes to the biggest event in his life, Andy Murray is happy to take a back seat. The 2013 Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist has revealed he has left the vast majority of planning next week's wedding to his fiance, Kim Sears. Scroll down for video . Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week - he is pictured as best man at brother Jamie's wedding to Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix House Hotel in 2010 . Murray was presented with a cake to mark his 500th ATP Tour victory cake in Miami this week - for his wedding he has said he was involved in the cake tasting, but has left the majority to his fiancee . Miss Sears, 27, pictured in Miami, has been been entrusted with planning the pair's wedding next week . Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral next week, and the tennis star has admitted he 'couldn't care less' about the finer details of the day saying 'I try to stay out of all that sort of stuff'. However Murray, a self-confessed foodie, will have some input for the wedding as he has chosen the menu based on a series of food tasting sessions. In an American interview, the 2012 US Open winner, said: 'I think in a lot of cases it's just better to let the woman have it how she would like. 'In terms of flowers and colour schemes and those sorts of things, I couldn't really care less about that, to be honest. 'The only thing I wanted to do was to be involved with the food. Because I like my food - I like good food. 'I went along and did the food tasting, and I also did the cake tasting as well. So that would be the thing that I would say I have been most involved in.' He added: 'The music is something we chat about together as well.' Miss Sears is in charge of colours schemes and flowers as Murray admits 'he couldn't care less about that' The 27-year-old has been a permanent fixture at the court side since she and Murray started dating in 2005 . Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005 . The couple have dated since they met in 2005 . Murray and Miss Sears, who have been together for a decade, will wed at the 1000-year old Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 12th century cathedral is much larger than the chapel in the grounds of Cromlix, which seats only 28. Murray purchased the 15-bedroom country home for £1.8m in 2013. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dunblane on the day to celebrate the wedding of their most famous son. Murray attended the primary school in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed sixteen children and one teacher in the Dunblane massacre. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. 'Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I'm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.' The cathedral's minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, added: 'There is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.' Tom Casey, chair of Discover Dunblane, the organisation which represents the town's traders, said the couple would be 'Dunblane's royalty'. He said: 'A number of shops will be doing individual things to mark the event as they normally do when Andy is playing tennis. 'As a town, we are going to put up some bunting and wedding bows along the high street and decorate the shops with messages. 'Of course we will be making extra efforts to celebrate the wedding of Dunblane's most famous son of modern sense. He is our royalty. 'But it is also important we respect the family's wishes.' Next week's ceremony will take place at the 12th century Dunblane Cathedral (pictured) The reception will then be at Cromlix House (pictured), the five-star 15-bedroom country hotel Murray bought for £1.8million two years ago . The couple announced their engagement in November last year. Breaking with tradition, Murray will have three best men at his wedding, his brother Jamie, close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins (who recovered from cancer to return to tennis) and former training partner Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Murray said: 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, ""why is that fine for you?"" 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. 'She was like, ""Come on, come on, pick one"". I said, ""No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come'."" Murray has previously played best man at Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins tied the knot with Lindsay Wood last year. The tennis star roars in celebration after defeating Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi final yesterday . In previous interviews on the subject, Murray has said he is not fazed by the prospect of marriage. 'Kim and I had spoken about getting married a lot for the past couple of years but, if you go back a couple of years, we were still only 25. 'We've been together since we were 18. Because we were so young when we started - and we do spend a lot of time apart - it just felt like the right time for both of us.' Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. They split briefly in 2009, before rekindling their relationship. The couple live in Surrey with their two Border terriers, Maggie and Rusty. Back on the court, Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open tomorrow.

Dallas Seavey managed to beat his 55-year-old father to the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning with a time of eight days, 18 hours, 13 minutes and six seconds - five hours slower than his record-setting performance last year. In reward for his win, the married father-of-one scored a check for $70,000 and a brand new Dodge SUV valued at $40,000. During the race, Seavey's dogs traveled an average of 7.6mph in temperatures as low as 50 below zero. Apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line, with a windburned face to match. Iditarod winner: Dallas Seavey beat his 55-year-old father to the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning with a time of eight days, 18 hours, 13 minutes and six seconds . Zapped by the cold: Apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line, with a windburned face to match . An exhausted Seavey, who also won the Iditarod in 2012 and 2014, petted and hugged his dogs after their victory. 'It takes a whole team to get any of us here,' he told reporters at a finish line ceremony, which was broadcast and live-streamed. Later, he hoisted two of his dogs onto his lap and officials draped the animals with garlands of yellow flowers. 'As long as you take care of the dog team (and) make good decisions, good things will happen. Wins are a result of doing what we love,' Seavey said, adding that he tried to keep the race fun. He said he and his father, Mitch Seavey, who won titles in 2013 and 2004, encouraged each other along the way. The elder Seavey was in second place. Coming up with the goods: In reward for his win, the married father-of-one scored a check for $70,000 and a brand new Dodge Ram truck valued at $40,000 . Team effort: The younger Seavey said he and his father, Mitch (pictured above), who won titles in 2013 and 2004, encouraged each other along the way . Pit stop: Seavey tends to his lead dogs shortly after arriving at the Koyuk, Alaska, checkpoint during the Iditarod race on Monday, March 16 . Dallas Seavey increasingly put distance between himself and the rest of the field during the latter part of the race. He held a 25-mile advantage early Tuesday - a far cry from how he won the race last year. He was running third in the 2014 Iditarod when a freak snowstorm blew the leaders out of the race, and Seavey didn't know he had won the race until a cameraman broke the news to him. The winner's purse increased this year, and the top prize was $19,600 more than what he pocketed for last year's race. 'I'm pretty tired right about now - it's been a tough race,' he said. 'The cold zaps you. The dogs, they're very lively, but it takes a lot of effort to keep them well-fed, keep them rocking and rolling. This is a hard dog team to keep up with.' Aaron Burmeister was running in third place, while Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle were battling for fourth. Royer and Zirkle each had attempted to become the first woman to win the race since the late Susan Butcher won her fourth title in 1990. Poor weather south of the Alaska Range this year forced the official start farther north to Fairbanks, on the northern side of the mountains. Not much snow fell south of the range, and officials said the conditions in the normally treacherous Dalzell Gorge were made even more dangerous by a lack of snow. That's the location where many mushers crashed their sleds in 2014, causing many to scratch. Dinner is served: Seavey makes food for his dogs - the canines burn thousands of calories a day on the race . Close shave: Dallas Seavey looks back at Aaron Burmeister, whom he had just passed, as they head into the Koyuk, Alaska, checkpoint . Other comptetitors: Aaron Burmeister was running in third place (pictured), while Jessie Royer and Aliy Zirkle were battling for fourth . A new race route also was created, with much of it run on river ice. The new route allowed new communities to serve as checkpoints, including the Athabascan community of Huslia, famed for its sprint sled dog races. The ceremonial start in Anchorage went on as planned on March 7. Snow had to be trucked in so mushers could navigate paved streets, but there was little snow elsewhere in the city. The snow brought in for the race barely lasted the few hours it was needed because of temperatures nearing 40 degrees and rain. A total of 78 mushers began the race March 9 in Fairbanks. Eight scratched, and one was disqualified. Two dogs have died in this year's race, including one that was hit by a car after getting loose during the ceremonial start. The other dog that died was on the team of four-time champion Lance Mackey.",61,101,"match, murray, won, title, round, open, win, final, set, champion,","crown, grand, race, hamilton, team, track, formula, collision, ferrari, adelaide,","final match, win the title, this year's champion, won the final round","formula 1 race, ferrari team, collision during the race, hamilton's team, grand prix, race track","This topic is about a final match to determine which team will win the final round, winning the title to become this year‚Äôs champion.","This topic is about Formula 1 racing, the Grand Prix on the race track, Hamilton‚Äôs team and the Ferrari team, and collisions during a race.","Dallas Seavey won his 3rd Iditarod race in the last 4 years.

The group, who posted the performance video to Facebook and Youtube, explained that they composed the tune after experiencing a 'lack of respect shown by Ryanair flight attendants.' In the video, the band's lead singer strums a ukulele as the group serenades passengers on board - despite Ryanair's scathing review of the sarcastic ditty. A well-known Spanish band from Catalonia, called Sidonie, sang an impromptu song aboard a Ryanair flight . While en route to Santiago, the band grew impatient with the alleged 'lack of respect' from flight attendants . Although sung in their native tongue, the lyrics read: 'Ryanair, how we like Ryanair, and its flight attendants, they could not be nicer'. Clearly meant to be ironic, some passengers even join in and sing or clap along as the band repeats the chorus during their impromptu performance. Explaining the motivation behind their hilarious video, the band wrote online: 'After receiving, repeatedly, the habitual lack of respect shown by flight attendants on the Ryanair route to Santiago, we were moved to compose and perform a song dedicated to them and their irritable airline.' Ryanair, however, wasn't as impressed with the band's performance. Robin Kiely, a spokesperson for the airline told MailOnline Travel: 'Sidonie? More like sit down mate. 'The lyrics are average, the vocals out of tune, the ukulele playing leaves a lot to be desired and there isn't one trumpet.' Taking matters into their own hands, the group composed and performed a tongue-in-cheek tune . As they paraded up and down the aisle of the plane, some passengers even began to sing along with the lyrics . The band also posted the video to Facebook, adding that the song was dedicated to the 'irritable airline' 'We much prefer our new on-time landing music, which will be heard on over 90 per cent of our flights this year, as we carry 100 million customers,' Kiely added. Ryanair is famous for complaints about its customer service and surcharges, and it has recently launched a marketing campaign and measures such as allocated seating to win over passengers.

The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much.

The incident was reported to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the LA Times reported. There have been a record number of sea lions washing up on Southern California beaches in 2015. Nearly 2,000 of the animals have washed up on the state's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups, saying there has been 'an unusually large increase' in sea lion strandings. In January and February, strandings were 20 times the average rate for those two months. Experts believe warming sea temperatures might be responsible for the enormous rise in strandings because the availability of fish and other sea lion food sources has been affected.

The Belgian striker, back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games, said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone. Villa are six points clear of Queens Park Rangers in 18th but the gap could close this weekend with Burnley and Leicester in Premier League action and Sherwood's team in the FA Cup semi-final. Christian Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham . Benteke points to the skies in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke said: 'The more the better, I think it's risky to say we can take three points and we're finished. We have to try to win every game. 'Saturday was a massive three points because now we're six points clear of QPR so it's very important for us to be far off them.' Benteke, 24, said the match against Brendan Rodgers' team at Wembley was the biggest of his career. 'For the moment, yes,' he said. 'It (missing the World Cup) was hard but now it's in the past, I'm looking forward to playing the semi final. Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . 'Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. 'Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.' Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences. He added: 'He (Sherwood) said to the team we have to play to our strengths, to play with me and Gabby.

Matthew Bird, from Ashburton, New Zealand, halved his income by quitting his well-paid job as an agricultural adviser to become a mechanic after he realised he would be expected to pay around $1,900 a month in child support payments. He said he was happy to give up is $70,000 a year pay check for a meagre wage of $38,000 a year, if it meant his child support payment dropped to $554 a month. Matthew Bird said he was happy to give up is $70,000 a year pay check for a meagre wage of $38,000 a year, if it meant his child support payment dropped to $554 a month . Inland Revenue recently amended their child support formula which was enforced on April 1. Mr Bird has fathered three children and was previously expected to pay $1,300 a month in child support. He said once the changes were implemented his payment rose by $600, to a total of $1,900 a month. 'I'm on half wage but I pay a third of what I used to,' Mr Bird told NZ media. He said the increased figure is 'unreasonable' and he believes illegal employment will flourish under the new system. Truck driver Dean Sorenson, 28, said he's also facing financial difficulty after his child support payments increased by $172-a-month. He said while he had considered changing jobs to reduce his payment, he thought his family would end up worse off if he did. New Zealand MP Jo Goodhew said those who were struggling with the new formula could come into her office to discuss how changing jobs could affect their future payment. Ms Goodhew has invited parents to her office to discuss how the new calculations are affecting their wage . As child support payments are calculated on information provided to Inland Revenue by parents, they have advised that parents check the information they gave is still up to date to ensure their payment has been calculated correctly. A spokeswoman for Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean said her office had received three inquiries about the changes to child support payments.

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said.

Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported.

Joanna Leigh claims the indictment is retribution for her vocal criticism of the way One Fund Boston disbursed the funds. Authorities say Leigh, 41, collected almost $40,000 from One Fund and other sources after claiming to have suffered a brain injury during the attack. They say she received $8,000 payment from One Fund Boston, which was set up to compensate bombing victims. She's also accused of receiving $1,700 from a school fundraiser, collecting more than $9,000 in contributions from an online fundraiser and getting more than $18,000 in benefits from the Massachusetts Victims for Violent Crime compensation fund. The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack. But Boston Police and Suffolk County investigators say she wasn't hurt. She apparently did not claim any injury or seek any medical treatment until about two weeks later. ""When she did begin to make those claims, she billed herself as a 'hero' who ran toward the second blast,"" authorities said. Leigh says the indictment is payback for her criticism of One Fund. She and others have claimed they weren't properly compensated by the fund because of the way it calculated payments. If someone's injury didn't require an overnight hospital stay, he or she received $8,000. Those who were hospitalized got $125,000 or more. ""I don't think this is about me; I think this is because I spoke out about The One Fund,"" she told the Boston Globe on Thursday. ""I think this is about killing the messenger.""

Ex-Bolton Wanderers forward Delroy Facey, 34, is also alleged to have told a contact that some Football Conference teams would 'do' a game in return for payment. Facey, whose former clubs include Hull City and West Bromwich Albion, is accused of conspiring with non-league player Moses Swaibu and others to commit bribery. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) is alleged to have contacted a non-league player via WhatsApp to fix matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . On the second day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, prosecutor Nick Mather claimed records of online messages showed Facey had approached footballers about 'throwing' lower league matches. In one text conversation, conducted on messaging service WhatsApp in late 2013, Facey is alleged to have tried to corrupt Greater Manchester-based Hyde FC player Scott Spencer by offering him £2,000. The court heard that Facey, of Huddersfield, made contact with Mr Spencer shortly after discussing Hyde's poor run of form with a convicted match-fixer. Mr Spencer, who the court heard was not involved in any form of match-fixing, is alleged to have been messaged by Facey, who told him: 'You lot (Hyde) get rinsed out, week in, week out. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . 'You lot should make some money out of this lad, easy money. 'Check this out. Four goals in a game - two in either half - and you guys can get 2k each, win lose or draw. 'You guys can't win for s*** so you may as well make some peas.' During the WhatsApp conversation, which was read to jurors by Mr Mather, Facey is alleged to have added that a friend who was betting would provide the cash. Addressing the jury on the second day of his opening speech, Mr Mather claimed Facey was attempting to bribe Mr Spencer and team-mates that he trusted into fixing a match. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Mr Mather further alleged that Facey told a convicted match-fixer in another message: 'I have got (Football) Conference teams that will 'do' a game but how much?' Transcripts of messages which passed between Facey and 43-year-old Krishna Ganeshan, who was found guilty of conspiracy at an earlier trial, were also shown to the jury. In an exchange on October 28 2013, the court heard, Ganeshan used Skype to contact Facey, telling him: 'Get ready, things are about to come to life. Keep your boys on stand-by. 'If they deliver first time, me and only you are in big business for the future.' Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 .

The Florida Senator told Bob Schieffer that he wasn't against gay marriage, but believes the 'definition of the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman'. Scroll down for video . Marco Rubio told Face The Nation he believes people are born with a sexual preference, but insisted same-sex marriage should not be a constitutional right . He added: 'States have always regulated marriage. And if a state wants to have a different definition, you should petition the state legislature and have a political debate. 'I don't think courts should be making that decision. 'I don't believe same-sex marriage is a Constitutional right,' Rubio continued. 'I also don't believe that your sexual preferences are a choice for the vast and enormous majority of people. 'In fact...I believe that sexual preference is something that people are born with.' Last week, during an interview with Fusion magazine, he said if someone he 'cared' for was involved in a same-sex union he would 'of course attend'. He added: I'm not going to hurt them simply because I disagree with a choice they've made or because I disagree with a decision they've made, or whatever it may be. 'Ultimately, if someone that you care for and is part of your family has decided to move in one direction or another or feels that way because of who they love, you respect that because you love them.'

Some members of the terrorist cell had direct contact with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before his death in Pakistan in 2011, wiretaps showed, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported. And wiretaps and other intelligence revealed that the group planned to carry out terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in Italy, according to Caligari Chief Prosecutor Mauro Mura. Some evidence indicated the Vatican was among the targets considered, police said. Talk of this took place March 2010, around the time a possible suicide bomber from Afghanistan entered Italy, Mura said. Police said, too, that some of the suspects were involved in a Pakistani market bombing in 2009 in which more than 300 people were killed and injured . The suspects had been under surveillance for years, some as far back as 2005, police said. On Friday, Italian State Police closed in, carrying out raids in seven provinces in what they called a first-of-its-kind operation. One of the raids targeted the alleged terrorist cell's headquarters on the island of Sardinia. The operation, which is still going on, is expected to result in the arrest of 18 people, most of them from Pakistan, said spokesman Paolo Meloni, who represents the police in Sassari, Sardinia, where the investigation is being coordinated. Some suspects had an abundance of weapons and moved cash around the world, police said. One was apprehended on a flight from Italy to Pakistan while carrying 55,000 euros, or nearly $60,000, police said. Meloni said the provinces in which the raids were being carried out included Frosinone and Macerata, which are in central Italy, as well as Bergamo, in the north. Some of those expected to be arrested are suspected of having been involved in the 2009 car bombing in Pakistan, Meloni said. In that bombing, in a bazaar in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 137 people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Still other suspects are suspected of involvement in migrant trafficking, he said. Police said the group tried to recruit to its cause the migrants it transported.

The Lowy Institute report, released on Thursday, says the large number of Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq represents a 'serious national security threat' but that the risk of an attack on home soil could be mitigated by the right policy response. The new report comes just a day after the news of the death of Melbourne model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama. The Australian was reportedly killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State. Scroll down for video . A report on the threat posed by Australian foreign fighters has blamed the Abbott government's troubled relations with the Muslim community for worsening the situation . Melbourne'sSharky Jama was reportedly shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State last year . Mohamed Elomar (above) is a boxer-turned-terrorist who fled Sydney to join the Islamic State in Syria . The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Khaled Sharrouf's fled to Syria from western Sydney. His 14-year-old daughter married Mohamed Elomar . Sharrouf posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head, causing international uproar . The new report outlines how returned fighters pose a serious threat to Australians. 'Returned foreign fighters have been involved in many of the most serious jihadist plots in the West, including in Australia,' the report says. 'Returnees from Syria have already engaged in terrorist plots in Europe, and the large number of Australians involved with groups such as IS (Islamic State) and Jabhat al-Nusra raises well-founded fears of an increased threat at home.' While much of the responsibility in dealing with the threat will lie with the police and intelligence services, the report says, it adds that programs aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE) need to be a core element of the response. The report says 'questions remain' as to how any new CVE approach will be implemented by the government, and that 'troubled relations with Australia's Muslim communities mean that its efforts to counter violent extremism are not off to the strongest of starts'. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Australian Mahmoud Adullatif, who is known as the 'Playboy Jihadi', died recently while fighting for IS . Melbourne woman Zehra Duman (pictured above) was married to Abdullatif and has threatened Australia . A successful CVE approach should draw on the talent that already exists within relevant communities, the report said, but that 'community co-operation has been undermined' by a lack of information about changes to the government's approach, including funding of grant schemes. 'Moreover, the poor consultation by the government with the Muslim community on much of Australia's new counter-terrorism legislation as well as the Prime Minister's (Tony Abbott) claim that Muslim leaders are not doing enough to speak out against radical ideas have undermined the prospects for effective co-operation.' The report said the Abbott government's introduction of number of CVE programs, such as $13.4 million Living Safe Together initiative, had been welcomed but that there were also valuable lessons to be learned from European countries, which had more experience in addressing the current foreign fighter threat.

Any Australians currently fighting with non state militants have been urged to return home immediately.

27,3Z2R0DQ0JJGB7KFMATRNKXDL3O7E2T,c81b4dafbb52311915c60dfcce7cb4f9f4888725,"Rome (CNN)As the dust settles after Italy's high court ruled on Friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for Amanda Knox, 27, and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 31, in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, many questions still linger in the case. Knox and Sollecito were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts. But now they are free now, forever cleared. There won't be any civil trials like in the O.J. Simpson case because, according to Italian penal code, Italy's high court decision is final across all courts in the country. According to Italian lawyer Nicola Canestrini, who works on extradition and criminal cases between Italy and other countries, . ""The high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system."" What now for the Kerchers? Francesco Maresca, lawyer for the Kercher family, told CNN that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling. ""We expected more from the Italian judicial system,"" he said. ""This is a failure to find justice for Meredith."" Maresca says the Kerchers could try to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and argue that Italy failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision. ""If they think Italy hasn't fulfilled the duty, they could sue Italy,"" Canestrini told CNN. Such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to Rudy Guede, a man from the Ivory Coast who was convicted for his role in Kercher's murder in 2008 in a fast-track trial that is still under seal. When the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010, they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were. Knox and Sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal. They applied to Italy's high court to be put under house arrest but because Knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk, they were both denied. Sollecito may now have cause to sue Italy for false imprisonment. Italy pays around 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges, according to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system. But, Canestrini says if Sollecito at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested, he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held. Sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with Knox, so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest. Canestrini also says that Knox could potentially sue Italy for one year of false imprisonment, but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest, she would likely not have much of a case. ""Because she initially admitted to a role in the crime, she wouldn't likely win. If a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested, it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned,"" Canestrini says. In one of her initial interrogations in 2007, she told investigators she was in the house when Kercher was killed at which time she accused Patrick Lumumba, her boss at a pub where she worked, of the murder. She later recanted that statement, but Lumumba spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim. In 2013, Italy's high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three-year prison term and ordered her to pay Lumumba $40,000 euro. Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told CNN that Knox doesn't feel any revenge or resentment towards Italy. In fact, he said she will go back one day. ""This has been an nightmare for her, so we finally got the right decision,"" he said. ""We always thought this was the only decision possible."" Sollecito's lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome. ""The verdict that we just received doesn't prove us partly right, It proves us completely right,"" Giulia Bongiorno told reporters outside the court. ""There were two possible verdicts: (One was to) overturn this verdict, but go back to it later. Instead, the overturn is without any referral. Among all the possible and imaginable overturning options, this is the one which says ""be advised, we won't ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of Raffaele Sollecito in this case ever. Enough, enough, enough."" Knox, too, made her own statement from her mother's home in Seattle after hearing the news. She thanked all those who supported her innocence, and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means. When asked if she had a message to the Kerchers about their daughter, she said, ""She deserved so much in this life. I'm the lucky one.""",195,78,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","court, judge, case, appeal, justice, order, ruling, ruled, magistrates, ordered,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","a court ruling, department of justice, appealed against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, court order, magistrates","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about a court ruling, department of justice, appealing against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, a court order, and magistrates.",Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are now cleared of the charge of murder of Meredith Kercher.

The technology paves the way for London's commuters to chat and text inside the capital's 150 Tube stations where Wi-Fi connections are currently available. London's Underground platforms could soon be drowned in the sound of commuters chatting on their phones . iPhone users on EE will find their calls and texts automatically connect through the internet when they have no service signal.

While it is already possible to make phone calls or send messages via Wi-Fi with apps such as WhatsApp and Viber, the new technology works automatically in the user's phone. After having downloaded the update, EE users on iPhone will see a Wi-Fi Calling section appear in the settings app of their phone, which must be switched to allow to enable the feature.

Kilcoy State School is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area, but parents have been urged to take vaccination more seriously there. The Sunshine Coast Daily reports that infectious diseases expert Professor Matthew Cooper, a professorial research fellow at the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, attributed the outbreak to an anti-vaccination trend. Parents have been accused of not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted whooping cough . 'It's unfortunately just part of a growing trend that many people have decided not to immunise,' he said. 'We've seen this with other diseases that are more serious than pertussis but unfortunately the more people who choose not to immunise the more likely it is we'll get outbreaks.'

A Slovakian lorry driver who killed three members of the same family and injured eight others after ploughing into the back of stationary traffic on a motorway has been jailed. Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic, which had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning. Helen Akande, 22, and her sister Mary, 16, both students from Sarcelles, France, died at the scene of the crash in April last year, while their father Michael, 54, died two weeks later in hospital as a result of his injuries. Three people in another vehicle suffered serious injuries, including a boy aged seven who suffered a severe brain injury, a boy aged three who had a broken leg and a 36-year-old man with a fractured skull and brain injury. Orsula, of Topolcany, Slovakia, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously. He was jailed for six and a half years, and disqualified from driving for seven years. Crash: Traffic had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning . Sentencing: Orsula pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously . Detective Constable David Holmes, from Kent Police, said: 'The events of that day will linger long in the memory of those affected, some of whom will never fully recover from their injuries. 'Juraj Orsula claims he was blinded by the sun in the moments leading up to the collision, which should have been reason enough to reduce his speed. 'Instead he continued to drive as normal before crashing into stationary traffic and leaving a trail of devastation. He must now live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.'

A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband. Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared ""I do"" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her ""first and only"" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of ""offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,"" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002. All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages. Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called ""red-flagged"" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.

Scroll down for video . Triplets Erin, Eliah and Elsie have joined Coronation Street as the youngest cast members taking it in turns to play the daughter of Faye Windass. Pictured here with father Martyn Halliwell and mother Laura Slinger . The five-month-old triplets were selected after parents Martyn Halliwell and Laura Slinger, from Padiham, near Burnley, put them forward after hearing that triplets are often in high demand in television. Martyn said: 'My cousin, who is a theatre actor, suggested that we should get in touch with an agent. He said ""there is a high demand for twins, let alone triplets"". 'We sent some photos over and within two hours we heard back to say they had a client who was interested. On the Monday we were at Coronation Street.' Martyn, 29, a sales manager, and Laura, 26, a beautician, are delighted at how well the girls, born on October 27, have taken to being on the soap. And the family has received a warm welcome from all the cast and crew - particularly from Ellie Leach, who plays teen mum Faye in the controversial storyline, and her mum Anna, played by Debbie Rush. Martyn says that despite only being a few months old his baby daughters are already developing quite a talent when it comes to being on screen. The triplets are swapped each scene while playing the daughter of Faye in the controversial story line that saw the Corrie character give birth at just 13-years-old . 'Everybody is shocked at how good they are,' he said. 'One of the triplets cries on cue, so when they need a crying baby we take Elsie down for filming. When they need a calm baby we take Erin. 'Everybody wants to look at the girls and they make a fuss of them, especially Debbie and Ellie. Ellie has been fantastic with the girls.'

This was revealed by his brother Scott during a hearing to determine if Hinckley should be able to permanently live outside St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and instead with his mother, where he has resided 17 days out of the month since December 2013. Scroll down for video . John Hinckley Jr. (above) has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting . This was revealed by his brother Scott (above) during a hearing to determine if he should be released from the institution he has been at since shooting President Reagan . Hinckley currently splits his time between St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia (above) Scott went on to describe his brother and his new girlfriend as 'somewhat compatible,' though he admitted he had not met the woman. Hinckley's mother Joan has been introduced to her son's girlfriend reports NBC News. Hinckley shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Testimony is expected to wrap up next week to determine if he can move in permanently with his mother, but it could be months before US District Judge Paul Friedman renders a decision. Prosecutor Colleen Kennedy has argued that the provisions suggested for expanded release were inadequate for a would-be presidential assassin. Hinckley also has written to killers Ted Bundy and Charles Manson, and in January he deceived doctors about where he was going when he was away from St. Elizabeths, she said. 'Now is not the time to loosen the reins of the hospital,' she said. Hinckley's mother Joan (above) has been introduced to her son's girlfriend . Hinckley (left) shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster in 1981 (right) Initial testimony centered on whether Hinckley's family could bear the financial cost of supporting him and his care. Prosecutors put the cost at $5,000 to $10,000 a month, and said the family would run out of money in one or two years. But his siblings, who both live in Dallas, said the value of their mother's retirement fund and home totaled about $500,000, and vowed to support him financially. During a 2011 hearing, prosecutors argued Hinckley repeatedly engaged in deception when away from the hospital. Secret Service agents saw him browsing books on Reagan and on other presidential assassins in 2011 instead of going to a movie, as he had told doctors he would.

Cudjoe-Calvocoressi left the station but was soon found and arrested by police and was charged with indecent exposure. When interviewed by police he initially denied that he had deliberately exposed himself, but when he appeared at Berkshire Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to the offence. At the school's internal investigating meeting Cudjoe-Calvocoressi admitted that he had exposed himself - but said that he did not realise he was causing distress.

With England cricketers toiling at the World Cup, Harmison is embroiled in a relegation struggle, although since he took over last month, the 36-year-old has overseen a change in fortunes with three victories and two defeats. His side are also in the semi-final of the Northern League Cup. The Northern League side have won three and lost two in Harmison's first five games in charge . The former England cricketer have a chance of some silverware after reaching the semi-finals of the cup . His aching back, a legacy of the punishing strain of bowling balls at nearly 100mph, still causes him pain, but the camaraderie of a team environment makes up for it. 'I've always been asked if I miss playing (cricket). No, not one bit,' Harmison, who retired from cricket in 2013, told the Sunday Times. 'But I miss the dressing room like you've never seen. 'Ashington is not a very big place so if you come from Ashington you support the cricket team and you support the football team. The northeast is like that.' The ex-fast bowler admits he doesn't miss playing the game of cricket but he misses the dressing room . Ashington holds a special place in Harmison's heart. He was born in the town and his father was a stalwart for the club as a player and later an assistant manager. 'Managing anyone else would not have been interest to me,' Harmison added. 'It tells you what Ashington means to all of us. 'To the family it means a hell of a lot. It tells you a lot that in 1966 he's there as a boy in the background and in 2015 I'm managing the place. 'Did anyone from my family say, 'Are you sure?'. Yes, James (Harmison's brother and first signing as manager). He knew what was coming. My wife was fine, the kids are loving it. It all fell into place. Ashington FC are the only club Harmison would manage due to how much the club means to him .

As she kicks off her bid to enter the White House, Hillary Clinton could claim that her path to the presidency began some 160 years ago in the little-known Welsh parish of Ystradyfodwg ‚ if she can pronounce it, that is. For while the US Democrat has previously spoken of her British ancestry, a definitive family tree has revealed her links to a poor mining community in the Welsh Valleys. Ystradyfodwg, pronounced Ust-rady-vod-ug, was the home of Mrs Clinton's great grandmother - a woman who showed a determination, similar to that of the former First Lady, to struggle through poverty and eventually emigrate to America with her family. In fact Mrs Clinton's steely resolve to get to the White House and make history as the first female president, can be seen in the actions of her female ancestors, who even defied social conventions through the years. US genealogy expert Megan Smolenyak has traced Mrs Clinton's roots to a mining family from Ystradyfodwg, a small community in south Wales. It is named after Dyfodwg, or Tyfodwg, a sixth century Welsh saint who some believe may have been a Breton Monk. The district, known for its reliance on coal mining and poverty, has since been abolished and is now part of Rhondda. Mrs Clinton's great-grandmother Mary Griffiths was born in Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh Valleys, and from an early age supported her widowed mother. Official records show she was working as a servant by the age of 12 but in reality she may have been working even earlier. Ms Smolenyak said: 'Born around 1850 in Merthyr Tydfil ‚ at that time, the largest town in Wales ‚ she [Mary Griffiths] can be found in the 1851 census living with her widowed mother and three older siblings. 'Fatherless by the age of one, Mary Griffiths had already been dealt a tough hand.' Scroll down for video . She went on to marry William Jones, a coal miner from Neath, in 1871 and the couple settled in Ystradyfodwg. In a bid for a better life the family made the lengthy journey via Ellis Island to Scranton in Pennsylvania, another mining district where they would continue their trade in the early 1880s. Shortly after they arrived Hannah Jones was born, sometime between 1882 and 1883. Mary Griffiths Jones continued as the head of the family, her husband mostly absent. Hannah Jones was one of just four children out of 14 born who survived - an indication of the poverty her traditional mining family lived in. Mrs Clinton's grandparents Hannah Jones (left) and Hugh Rodham eloped to wed in Binghampton, New York, and are pictured with their granddaughter, former First Lady Hillary Clinton . It was in America that Hannah Jones - who was to become Mrs Clinton's grandmother - met Hugh Rodham, part of the Rodham family who had travelled to America two years earlier from Northumberland. But the circumstances of their marriage reveal the poverty the Jones family endured and the wide social gulf between the Rodhams and Joneses at that time. The pair eloped to Binghampton in New York to get married - a place akin to Gretna Green where people would often go to wed because regulations were less strict. Hannah Jones' family hailed from a poor mining district which is now part of Rhondda in Wales . Mrs Clinton's family were from Ystradyfodwg, close to Neath and Merthyr Tydfil, and now part of Rhondda . From the family histories of the Jones and Rodham families, it appears the pair may have been forced to elope because the Rodhams were unlikely to have approved of their son marrying a woman from such a poor family when they had managed to become moderately wealthy after emigrating to America. Ms Smolenyak revealed that the Jones family were all miners while the Rodhams - who were to become Hannah Jones' in-laws - had left the trade after arriving in the US, and one even became a physician. Ms Smolenyak said: 'When Hugh Rodham found himself smitten with Hannah Jones, he had fallen for a girl who was regarded as being from ""the wrong side of the tracks."" Mrs Clinton announced she was running for president last week and toured the Whitney Brothers factory . If Hillary Clinton is successful she could make history as the first female president of the United States . 'If he hadn't been bold enough to wander across the state line to marry his sweetheart, Hillary's father wouldn't have born, erasing her from the scene. 'And if [Hillary] Rodham Clinton recalls her grandmother Hannah as a strong-willed woman who ""ruled everyone within her reach,"" it may have been a reflection of her determination to escape the circumstances that left her the sole survivor of her birth family of 16 by her early forties.' Hannah Jones Rodham, frequently described by Mrs Clinton as a 'strong willed woman' gave birth to Mrs Clinton's father Hugh E Rodham in 1911 and died in 1952 when Mrs Clinton was just five. 1850s - Mary Griffiths born in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales to poor family. 1851 - Miss Griffiths was living with her widowed mother and three siblings in Wales and by the age of 12 was working as a slave. 1871 - Miss Griffiths married William Jones, a coal miner from Neath near Swansea. They settled in Ystradyfodwg, near Merthyr Tydfil. 1880 - The Joneses moved to Scranton. 1882-1883 - Hannah Jones was born, one of 14 children - of which only four survived. 1902 - Hannah Jones eloped to Binghampton to marry Hugh S Rodham. He had been born in Northumberland and travelled to America with his family where he met Hannah Jones. 1911 - Hugh E Rodham born to the couple in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 1942 - Hugh E Rodham married Dorothy Howell Rodham, originally from Chicago. 1947 - Hillary Rodham, the eldest of the couple's three children was born. She later went on to marry Bill Clinton. 1952 - Hannah Jones Rodham dies, when Hillary is just five years old. The account appears to be the first definitive family tree for Mrs Clinton which traces her Welsh roots to an area of the Valleys. Previous versions appear to have been drawn incorrectly due to a mix-up over her grandmother. Ms Smolenyak claimed she discovered a key flaw in how genealogists previously compiled Mrs Clinton's family tree in misidentifying Hannah Jones. She said the mistake was made after two children of the same name were born in Scranton in Pennsylvania between 1882 and 1883, and experts previously 'latched onto' the incorrect Hannah Jones. Ms Smolenyak discovered the error while doing research for a piece about Mrs Clinton for Irish America and managed to trace the correct woman using marriage records and obituaries. She identified a woman born shortly after her family arrived in the US in the 1880s, Hannah Jones, who then went on to marry Hugh Rodham in 1902. The revelations come after Mrs Clinton herself appeared to make a mistake regarding her ancestry last week when she suggested all her ancestors were immigrants. She was later forced to correct the error after it was proven that Hannah Jones was born in the US in the 1880s.",115,113,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","Genealogists made an error when compiling Hillary Clinton's family tree.

Bell said: 'It's been at the back of my mind for some time that I got dropped the last time I was here for a Test series. So I wanted to make this one count and it was very satisfying to do so.

Bell shared century partnerships of 177 with Joe Root, who made 83 and another one of 130 with Ben Stokes who is 71 not out. 'It has to be right up there,' said Bell . It doesn't get much better. The partnership with Joe Root was just what we needed. But the West Indies bowled very well for the first two hours. And Ben Stokes made it a brilliant finish to the day.' Bell was dropped from the side on his last visit to the Caribbean in 2009 . Bell put on 177 for the fourth wicket with Joe Root and added 130 for the fifth wicket with Ben Stokes . ' It was my day today, but hopefully it will be someone else's day in the next innings.

A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 24% admit they are online constantly. It also household incomes can influence which social network children use - with Instagram and Snapchat being popular with children from wealthier families. A Pew Research Center survey found that 92 percent of US teens go online daily - and 25% admit they are online constantly. The Pew researcher revealed household incomes can influence which social network children use. That includes 56 percent who are online several times a day and 24 percent who say they are connected to the Internet and social networks 'almost constantly.' A key factor is the growing prevalence of smartphones. The survey of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 found that 73 percent had a smartphone and 30 percent had at least a basic cellphone. Even though 87 percent of teens have access to a computer, 91 percent went online daily using a mobile device at least occasionally, Pew found. The survey found that African-American and Hispanic youth are among the most active Internet users. Among African-American teens, 34 percent reported going online 'almost constantly' as did 32 percent of Hispanic youth and 19 percent of white teens. 'American teens, especially African-American youth, have embraced smartphones and the 24/7 access to people and information that they offer,' said Amanda Lenhart, a Pew researcher and the lead author of the report. Some 90 percent of teens with phones exchange text messages, with a typical teenager receiving 30 texts per day, Pew found. And one-third of those with smartphones use messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Kik. The researchers found Facebook remains the dominant social media network for young Americans despite the rise of new platforms. Among the teens surveyed, 71 percent said they used Facebook, with Instagram -- owned by Facebook -- the number two social media service used by 52 percent. Among the teens surveyed, Facebook was still the most popular . Asked about other social media, 41 percent of teens said they use Snapchat, 33 percent named Twitter and Google Plus, 24 percent were on Twitter-owned Vine and 14 percent used Yahoo-owned Tumblr. The figures appear to allay concerns that Facebook is being abandoned by youth as more older Internet users join the world's biggest social network. 'Even as Facebook remains an important platform for a majority of teens, Instagram is commanding the attention of half of teens, and Snapchat nearly that number,' said Lenhart. 'There are some interesting differentials in the most frequently used social platforms, with lower income teens using Facebook more often, while wealthier teens -- while still using Facebook -- are more likely than less wealthy teens to report that they use Snapchat or Twitter most often.' More than two-thirds of the teens surveyed said they use more than one social network. But of those who use only one, 66 percent said they opted for Facebook, with Google Plus and Instagram tied for second place with 13 percent each. The report was based on an online survey of 1,060 teens from September 25 to October 9, 2014 and February 10 to March 16, 2015. The margin of error was estimated at 3.7 percentage points.

Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border, where he later regained consciousness. The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier. The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine's once industrial heartland in ruins.

Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. On the ground, however, even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky.

55,3QFUFYSY90HDGCU59IUHVUVJ9A7F4L,c81b4dafbb52311915c60dfcce7cb4f9f4888725,"Rome (CNN)As the dust settles after Italy's high court ruled on Friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for Amanda Knox, 27, and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 31, in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, many questions still linger in the case. Knox and Sollecito were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts. But now they are free now, forever cleared. There won't be any civil trials like in the O.J. Simpson case because, according to Italian penal code, Italy's high court decision is final across all courts in the country. According to Italian lawyer Nicola Canestrini, who works on extradition and criminal cases between Italy and other countries, . ""The high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system."" What now for the Kerchers? Francesco Maresca, lawyer for the Kercher family, told CNN that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling. ""We expected more from the Italian judicial system,"" he said. ""This is a failure to find justice for Meredith."" Maresca says the Kerchers could try to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and argue that Italy failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision. ""If they think Italy hasn't fulfilled the duty, they could sue Italy,"" Canestrini told CNN. Such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to Rudy Guede, a man from the Ivory Coast who was convicted for his role in Kercher's murder in 2008 in a fast-track trial that is still under seal. When the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010, they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were. Knox and Sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal. They applied to Italy's high court to be put under house arrest but because Knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk, they were both denied. Sollecito may now have cause to sue Italy for false imprisonment. Italy pays around 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges, according to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system. But, Canestrini says if Sollecito at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested, he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held. Sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with Knox, so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest. Canestrini also says that Knox could potentially sue Italy for one year of false imprisonment, but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest, she would likely not have much of a case. ""Because she initially admitted to a role in the crime, she wouldn't likely win. If a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested, it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned,"" Canestrini says. In one of her initial interrogations in 2007, she told investigators she was in the house when Kercher was killed at which time she accused Patrick Lumumba, her boss at a pub where she worked, of the murder. She later recanted that statement, but Lumumba spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim. In 2013, Italy's high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three-year prison term and ordered her to pay Lumumba $40,000 euro. Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told CNN that Knox doesn't feel any revenge or resentment towards Italy. In fact, he said she will go back one day. ""This has been an nightmare for her, so we finally got the right decision,"" he said. ""We always thought this was the only decision possible."" Sollecito's lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome. ""The verdict that we just received doesn't prove us partly right, It proves us completely right,"" Giulia Bongiorno told reporters outside the court. ""There were two possible verdicts: (One was to) overturn this verdict, but go back to it later. Instead, the overturn is without any referral. Among all the possible and imaginable overturning options, this is the one which says ""be advised, we won't ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of Raffaele Sollecito in this case ever. Enough, enough, enough."" Knox, too, made her own statement from her mother's home in Seattle after hearing the news. She thanked all those who supported her innocence, and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means. When asked if she had a message to the Kerchers about their daughter, she said, ""She deserved so much in this life. I'm the lucky one.""",195,78,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","court, judge, case, appeal, justice, order, ruling, ruled, magistrates, ordered,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","a court ruling, department of justice, appealed against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, court order, magistrates","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about a court ruling, department of justice, appealing against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, a court order, and magistrates.","The High Court of Italy found Amanda Knox, 27, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 31, guilty in the murder of Meredith Kercher in 2007.

She already has 13 children and is due to retire this year ‚ so you'd think babies would be the last thing on her mind. But Annegret Raunigk is set to become the oldest woman in the world to have quadruplets ‚ at the age of 65. The German primary school teacher will give birth in a matter of weeks to four babies, conceived following 18 months of fertility treatment. Miss Raunigk, who features in a documentary on German television tonight, said she was not too worried about the birth, adding: 'I feel fit. I don't think I will have any problems.' She is in her 21st week of pregnancy after being artificially inseminated, using both donated sperm and eggs. The identity of the babies' father is unknown. Speaking of the moment she learned she was carrying quadruplets, she said: 'Sure, it was a shock for me. 'Once the physician established that there are four babies inside me then I had to do some thinking.' Miss Raunigk, who teaches English and Russian, said her gynaecologist mentioned the possibility of an abortion but she decided against this option. The mother, from Berlin, previously made headlines in Germany after giving birth to her youngest daughter Leila a decade ago, aged 55. Her 13 children ‚ the eldest of whom is daughter Antje, 44 ‚ are by five different fathers. Miss Raunigk's physician, Dr Kai Hertwig, said everything was going well. He added: 'So far her age has not come into play but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high risk. We are keeping a close watch on her heart circulatory system, but we have little or no experience with a woman of this age.'

'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said the Iraqi leader did not make a specific request for additional military support during the meeting.

'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS.

Vice President Joe Biden, left, and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said.

But not anymore. The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn, 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was ""likely a separate"" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement. Warren Weinstein, a U.S. citizen who was abducted by al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, died along with another hostage, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto, in the attack that killed Farouq, according to the White House. White House: U.S. hostage killed in strike on al Qaeda . While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization. Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish. He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002. A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998. Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar. The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road. The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb. In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist. He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic. He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online. A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included ""providing aid and comfort"" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists."" In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries. ""Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,"" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007. In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called ""a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera. Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" he said. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" In other videos, he called Nidal Hasan, the Army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, ""the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes,"" and praised the 2012 killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy. Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child.

Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Scroll down for video . 'Free' woman: Shelley Dufresne, 32, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time.

Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying.

Named as Abu Hafs al-Badri, the youthful teenager is claimed to be the cousin of Abu Bakr al-Bagdadhi, the extremist group's self-styled caliph. It appears ISIS's growing strategy of using teenage suicide bombers indicates their continued focus on indoctrinating impressionable local teenagers and turning them into deadly bombers. Not even old enough to grow a beard, teenage suicide bomber Abu Hafs al-Badri is claimed to be one of the cousins of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Basir al-Shami (left) and Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi (right) both blew themselves up in Iraq. Both boys appear to be be older than 16-years-old. al-Badri's martyrdom photo was released recently alongside fellow teenage suicide bomber Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi. The teenage duo carried out joint suicide missions in ISIS's latest offensive on the Baiji oil refinery in Salahuddin province, Iraq. Little is known about Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi except like Abu Hafs, he was an Iraqi national. Both fighters appear to be little older than 16-years-old. Another teenage suicide bomber Abu Basir al-Shami blew himself up in Anbar province, near the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Wearing a ISIS branded hat and awkwardly holding an AK 47 in his hands, the teenager stares emptily into the camera. Abu Qaqa al-Shami (left) and Abu Hassan al-Shami, (right) both Syrian nationals, carried out suicide lorry attacks in Iraq last month. Abu Qaqa al-Shami appeared in an ISIS video, shouting a torrent of jihaid slogans and practicing his shooting with an AK 47. al-Shami blew himself up at a checkpoint in North Baghdad. The teenager is shown singing as he drives a vehicle packed full of explosives towards a military checkpoint in Iraq. The trio of teenage suicide bombers come after another teenager was shown in a video, criticising the West before he carried out a suicide bomb attack. Known as Abu Qaqa al-Shami, the Syrian national drove a truck laden with explosives into a checkpoint in northern Baghdad. The boy has been named as Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, a Syrian fighter who appears to be no older than 14 years old. In a photo series, entitled 'Battle of Vengeance for the Mother of the Believers (Aisha)', the youngster is thought to be one of two Syrian fighters, who carried out a suicide truck bombings in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin. He is shown sitting in the driver's seat of the large lorry filled with barrels of explosives. The vehicle has been reinforced with plated armour, leaving the young driver with only a small rectangular window to navigate the final journey for his deadly vehicle. Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, who appears no older than 14, is thought to be the Islamic State's youngest suicide bomber . In a series of pictures, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade before the huge explosion of the lorry in January 2015. In his hands, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade and the barrel of his AK-47 rifle can be seen resting near the steering wheel between his legs. A final image shows a huge explosion after the detonation of the lorry, killing him and a number of Iraqi security forces. The attack happened near the ancient Iraqi city of Samarra, currently still held by the Iraqi army. It also shows a big ball of fire erupting into the orange sky, with pieces of shrapnel flying in all directions across the arid landscape. One ISIS supporter on social media commented: 'Abu al-Hassan al-Shami the martyr. His youth doesn't stop him from supporting his religion.'

While the drinks are said to have health benefits, some brands contain more than a day's recommended intake of sugar in a single 300ml serving. The Local Government Association, which represents councils that are responsible for public health, accused soft drink firms of 'dragging their heels' when it comes to minimising sugar in their products. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink (pictured left) was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, which is more than the amount in a can of Coca-Cola (right) It said children under the age of ten get almost a fifth of their sugar intake from soft drinks. In a survey, the organisation found that some cans of fizzy drinks contain almost twice the recommended daily sugar limit for adults. Even some fruit juices contain more than a single day's limit in a single serving ‚ surpassing a can of Coca-Cola. Ocean Spray Cranberry Classic juice drink was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml, while PomeGreat 'Super Juice' had 12.1g. Both exceed the 10.6g per 100ml in a can of Coca-Cola ‚ but do not come close to the 15.1g per 100ml in Old Jamaica Ginger Beer. A 300ml serving of any of the four drinks would breach the 25g daily sugar limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. Juice businesses insisted the study is misleading because it does not differentiate between unhealthy added sugar ‚ such as monosaccharides and disaccharides in fizzy drinks ‚ and natural sugar found in fruit. Cranberry juice is frequently promoted as a health product which is said to ward off urinary tract infections. And pomegranate juice has been linked to resistance to prostate cancer and heart disease. The LGA is calling for a fifth of the VAT raised on sugary drinks, sweets and takeaway food to go to councils to pay for public health schemes. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, Tory leader of Warwickshire county council and chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: 'It is wholly unacceptable for one normal-sized can of soft drink to contain double the recommended daily limit. 'Products like these are fuelling the obesity crisis and helping wean a generation of overweight children. 'We are calling on the sector as a whole to step up and show more corporate responsibility.' A spokesman for Ocean Spray said cranberries are naturally low in sugar, so sweetening is required. Vitamin Water is promoted for its health benefits, but drinks contain four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml . She added: 'We offer consumers a range of reduced sugar options including our Cranberry Classic Light product . 'We've made and continue to maintain a firm commitment to low-sugar innovation, and through product formulation, price promotion and portion sizes we seek to offer the best choice in flavours, calories and formats.' Adam Pritchard, chief executive of PomeGreat, accused the LGA of distributing misleading research. He said his product does not include refined sugar, which the WHO says is more harmful than naturally occurring fruit sugars. PomeGreat instead includes pinitol, a natural compound which stops blood sugar levels rapidly rising. Mr Pritchard said: 'To lump us in with big fizzy drinks companies is just misleading. 'We are a small company competing with huge multinational businesses which are just chucking sugar into drinks because it is cheap. 'We use a much more healthy natural sweetener which costs 2.5 as much as refined sugar.

In court on Friday, the judge told Hansen: 'You're a mother yourself. It's beyond me to understand your behavior.' Deputy District Attorney Kimberly Williams said that her office opposed the length of the sentence proposed by the judge but that she was happy to see Hansen take responsibility for her actions, according to the Press Enterprise.

I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry,' Hansen said through tears. The ex-teacher came under investigation two years ago after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen, and she was arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors said the crimes took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home between May 2012 and 2013, according to KTLA.

But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the ""Fast and Furious"" film franchise. The release of ""Furious 7"" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. ""He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion,"" military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. ""We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us,"" said Upham. The actor was on break from filming ""Furious 7"" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while ""retiring"" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying ""This movie is more than a movie."" ""You'll feel it when you see it,"" Diesel said. ""There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them."" There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the ""Today"" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. ""It's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face,"" Coleman said. ""Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts."" Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how ""Furious 7"" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. ""It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud,"" he said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.",115,236,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","film, movie, character, films, viewers, set, characters, bond, series, box,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","movie characters, the new series, action films, bond between the characters, viewers of the film","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about a new series based off action films, for which viewers of the film watch for the bonds between the characters.",Paul walker an actor of movie has fatal death at age of 40.

And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals . Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992 . Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie . Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta . However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp . Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000 . Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal . Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009 . Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011 . Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United . Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar.

With the wait almost over, release date for the whiz-bang time-piece is set down for April 24, the price comparison website finder.com.au suggests, if you haven't already pre-ordered, you might be better off waiting until next year for the second generation Apple Watch. 'If you want an Apple Watch battery that lasts longer than a day, better apps and GPS, you might be better off waiting,' said Michelle Hutchison, Finder's money expert. 'While the first generation Apple Watch is a very exciting piece of wearable technology, there are clearly many key features missing from the watch. If you're going to spend between $499 and $24,000 on the first edition, you might end up being disappointed with its functionality in 11 months time.' Scroll down for videos . The long-awaited Apple Watch is about to go from being on display to being on the wrist of buyers world-wide but a panel of technical experts claim it is far from perfect . The Apple Watch 1 will retail from $499 for the cheapest version right up to $24,000 for an 18-carat model . Michelle Hutchison and Jeremy Cabral from comparison website finder.com.au are among those who have run the rule of the soon-to-be released futuristic watch . The Apple Watch gadget went on sale on-line in nine countries and the initial stock sold out in just a few hours. Those who pre-ordered are expected to take delivery on Friday . While Apple is promoting the release with ads stating ""you're going to be amazed by how many things you can do with Apple Watch"", a survey of five Australian technology experts found a less than enthusiastic response to the current offerings available on the watch. They all expect the second version to be a vast improvement, pointing to a long lasting battery life as the number one feature missing from the current Apple Watch. Other key features which are absent, include an independent internet connection (the watch relies on an iPhone for data), GPS and water-proofing was also an issue. Apple proudly exclaims it to be 'our most personal device yet'. 'Apple Watch is unlike any device we've ever made,' the company states on its ""Watch Technology"" website. 'The result is an experience that's both unique to Apple Watch and quintessentially Apple. To make the best use of its size and location on your wrist, Apple Watch has all-new interactions and technologies. 'They let you do familiar things more quickly and conveniently.'

The Apple Watch 1 has been in high demand but some tech heads say version two might be worth waiting for . She also estimated that Apple Watch version two would be released on or around March 18, 2016. That was based on a study of release dates between Apple's first and second edition iPods, iPhones and iPads. Two new features the panellists expect to be available on the second version of the Apple Watch are the GPS facility, and being able to work more independently from the iPhone. Greater access for app developers is also likely to be available on the second version, so said the experts. Mike Rundle, the owner of Flyosity, said he wanted to see it 'work independently from the iPhone or won't need an iPhone to set it up'. He also hoped there would be better GPS capability, along with a 'thinner and faster device with a brighter screen' Chris Stead, Editor in Chief, Old Mate Media added: 'Better battery life is a given as Apple improve its tech efficiency.' 'We can also expect more user interface/control options, and greater access to those options for developers. 'This will be required if app makers are going to be able to make bespoke experiences that maximise the Apple Watch, as currently a number of features are gated off, presumably, to minimise quality assurance issues during the device's launch.' Mike Rundle (left) from Flyosity and Chris Stead of Old Mate Media were among the panel assembled to look at what Apple Watch 1 has to offer. Rundle wanted it to 'work independently of the iPhone' Mike Bantick (left) is from iTWire.com wants the Apple Watch to be water-proof while Angus Kidman (right) representing Lifehacker Australia on the panel said the new model should be altered to allow for more apps . But the number one technology upgrade that will have the biggest impact on the Apple Watch is the iPhone 7, according to those surveyed, followed by iOS9 ‚ the next mobile operating system ‚ and Apple Pay where users can make contact-less transactions through the so-called Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. 'The most exciting part about the Apple Watch and wearable technology is the endless potential for how these devices will change our lives,' said Ms Hutchison. 'From turning on our TV to pre-empting a heart attack, to the way we access information and how we pay for things, it has the potential to make our lives more convenient and even more productive.' Mike Bantick, Contributing Editor at iTWire.com has called for a water-proof sport version, with GP and headphone options, while Angus Kidman, the editor of Lifehacker Australia called on Apple to 'open SDK so there are more apps' and Jeremy Cabral, Head of Publishing and Editorial at Finder also wants to see it 'work independently to the iPhone'.

Holly Beard, 24, and her fiance Steve Hancock, 27, from Adderley Green, Staffordshire, tipped the scales at over 41st between them when they set a date for their big day in January last year. But Holly decided to slim down when she was teased at the opticians where she worked after her boss brought in a cake as a treat. Scroll down for video . Holly Beard and Steve Hancock reached a combined weight of 41st after moving in together . Before she could tuck in, a member of the public shouted at her: 'She doesn't need a cake - look at the size of her.' Holly, who has since left her job, was left mortified and crying in the toilet after being humiliated in front of her colleagues last April. After vowing to lose weight for her wedding day this May, she joined Weight Watchers in June last year. She has since gone from 17st 8lb to a slim 11st 9lb in just nine months. Steve also began to shed the pounds after joining Holly on her diet plan and switching his meals to align with hers. The warehouse manager lost 5st and going from 23st 7lb to a healthier 18st 7lb since June last year. But after Holly received cruel taunts in her workplace the couple went on a joint diet losing 11st between them . Holly, who lives with Steve says that before she started her diet she would eat without thinking. 'I was getting comfortable with Steve after we moved in together and I didn't realise how to look after myself properly. 'It was just eating too much of everything, too many potatoes, too much lasagne and a pudding after even when I wasn't hungry.' But after her embarrassing incident at work Holly knew that something had to be done. 'In April last year the boss had brought a cake for everybody as a treat that day. 'He gave us the cake and there was a patient standing next to me who shouted: ""She doesn't need a cake - look at the size of her."" 'It was awful. I cried in the toilets and cried the rest of the day. When other people lost weight, I would find myself defending my own weight. It was a horrible way to live. 'When I went to have a wedding dress fitted in June last year it was a size 22. I decided to join Weight Watchers that month and haven't looked back since.' The dramatic weight loss has also seen Holly slim down from a size 22 to a ten to 12 which has proven to be a nightmare for her wedding dress fitter. Holly went from 17st 8lb to a slim 11st 9lb in just nine months after joining Weight Watchers . 'I've had to have my dress fitted every two months because I am down to a size ten to 12 now. 'She has only just started making the dress and I haven't even seen it. I am giving the poor woman a heart attack.' Holly says that her new size will come as a shock when she gets married, especially guests who live far away. 'I lived in Scotland for half my life so there are so many people who haven't seen me this small. It will be a shock for them when I walk down the aisle.' As well as her health improving, Holly says that her confidence has seen a complete turnaround. 'I would never go out without make-up before. Now I don't even care what I wear because I know I look good on the outside, and I also feel good in myself. 'I'm always going to be curvy, but if Kim Kardashian can be curvy and slim, so can I. 'The best thing has been taking the journey with my future husband. Steve has done so well and I don't want people to forget that we've been through it together.' Steve says that he would never have reached his new weight without the help of his fianc. He said: 'I'm a typical man and I can't cook. Steve has gone from 23st 7lb to a healthier 18st 7lb since June last year . 'Holly cooks all my food and I couldn't have lost the weight without her. She is a different woman now. 'It's crazy how much we've both changed, and I'm so glad we did it before the wedding. It feels like a fresh start.' The couple halved the size of their portions and ate from smaller plates in order to lose weight for their big day. They also cut out carb-heavy lunches and dinners, instead eating healthier salads and well-balanced meals. The pair now plan to tie the knot in front of 40 friends and family at the Three Horseshoes Inn in Blackshaw Moor, Staffordshire on May 21. Holly's mother Pat visits her daughter - who now works as a weight loss consultant for Weight Watchers - every three months and has been stunned by the dramatic weight loss. She said: 'The support Holly and Steve have given each other has been incredible. The wedding gave them both something great to aim for. I'm just so proud. 'They have both been very enthusiastic and such an inspiration. They never looked back. I always thought my daughter looked nice, even before.

Some lawmakers are upset that lethal weapons haven't already been included as part of $75 million in new aid announced Wednesday. Asked during a White House press briefing to confirm that the U.S. won't send weapons to the former Soviet nation, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'That's not necessarily accurate.' 'I can't,' he said. 'The President, I think, in his own mind, is continuing to evaluate the situation in eastern Ukraine,' Earnest told reporters, 'and continuing to assess the risk that's associated with providing additional lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.' Scroll down for video . STILL ON THE TABLE: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration hasn't ruled out sending lethal military aid to Ukraine . BROKEN DOWN: Ukraine's military vehicles are being repaired with COINS where bullet-holes have made them otherwise unfit for new duties on the front lines . NEW COSTS? Russian President Vladimiar Putin has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula . Obama is weighing the consequences of putting new lethal weapons in the hands of Ukraine's military, weighing the risks that it could further inflame a conflict in which more than 6,000 people have already lost their lives. 'That bloodshed is something that we're trying to avoid and de-escalate,' Earnest said. 'So the president is very mindful of the potential risk that's associated with providing additional lethal military assistance to the Ukrainians.' Members of Congress from both parties have repeatedly urged Obama to provide Ukrainian soldiers with lethal weapons to defend themselves. Cory Fritz, spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, told the Associated Press that the new aid 'will be completely ineffective.' 'The Ukrainians are begging for help, and the Congress is begging the administration to provide the defensive lethal assistance we authorized in December. Our allies deserve better,' Fritz said. CHEWING IT OVER: Obama, seen Tuesday in Atlanta, Georgia, is said to be mulling the geopolitical pros and cons of standing up to Putin by sending new defensive weapons to Kiev . DEVASTATION: Pro-Russian rebels last week inspected the rubble of a destroyed coal mine that was used as a Ukrainian army outpost . In the Senate, a bipartisan group of 13 lawmakers wrote on Tuesday to Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top dogs on the Appropriations Committee, asking them to set aside funds specifically for 'defensive weapons' earmarked for Ukraine. 'While these weapons would not allow Ukraine to outmatch the Russian military, they would enable Ukraine to better defend itself and increase the costs of President Putin's aggression in Ukraine,' they wrote. 'By increasing costs for President Putin's aggression, it would discourage future aggression in eastern Europe that could even more directly threaten U.S. national security interests.' Another pair of senators, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, reached across the aisle to jointly demand that the White House green-light new weapons allocations. 'Now is the time for the United States to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself from continued Russian aggression,' the wrote in a letter to the president. 'We should not be misled by Vladimir Putin's repeated efforts to exploit nominal ceasefire agreements.' Putin, the president of Russia, has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Corker and Menendez said in their letter that providing defensive weapons to Ukraine could 'impose a greater military cost on Russia' for its aggressive movements. 'After countless broken promises by the Kremlin, it is clear that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine can only be stopped if Putin realizes that the United States and Europe are unequivocally committed to helping Kiev impose this military cost on Russia,' they insisted. HANGING ON BY A PRAYER: Father Alexandr Matveev led his congregation in servcies held in his office on March 8; their Russian Orthodox church's main hall was destroyed by Russian shelling in 2014 . APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED: US senators from both sides of the political aisle want the White House to send weapons to Ukrainian soldiers, and they're willing to spend taxpayer dollars to do it . Word of Wednesday's new aid package came in a telephone call Wednesday from Vice President Joe Biden to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The White House said Biden also expressed concern that Russian-backed separatists are violating cease-fire agreements in eastern Ukraine and keeping out international monitors. Earnest said the new aid includes unmanned drones to help defend Ukrainian forces and enhance their communication; radios and other secure communications equipment; radars to warn and protect against mortar and artillery fire; and medical equipment, including military ambulances. U.S. officials, speaking on a condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the aid on the record, said it includes small Raven drones systems, which can be launched by hand. The U.S. also will send 30 heavily armored Humvees and 200 other regular Humvees. It's not clear how many drones will be sent. Victoria Nuland, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that administration officials are discussing lethal assistance and are watching whether the agreements that led to last month's cease-fire are implemented. Nuland said that in the past few days, there have been new transfers of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery and rocket equipment over the border to the separatists in eastern Ukraine.",162,194,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","russian, russia, european, europe, ukraine, putin, moscow, greece, eastern, euro,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","Ukraine and Russia, called to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathered in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, bloc of nations within the European Union","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about Ukraine and Russia, calling to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathering in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, and a bloc of nations within the European Union.","During the White House Press conference the press asked the secretary about assistance intended to be given to Ukraine in the form of lethal weapons.

80,35GMH2SV3GJPER4RXRPKRAGODOSOEX,2115d44b6149180d7764dbccf41a5da132778339,"The red planet might still have liquid water, suggests information collected by Nasa's Curiosity rover. Researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on Mars. Now, new information from the Mars rover Curiosity, published in the journal Nature, shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet. The 'Hidden Valley' in Gale Crater on Mars. Very fine-grained sediments, which slowly fell down through the water, were deposited right at the bottom of the crater lake. The sediment plates at the bottom are level, so everything indicates that the entire Gale Crater may have been a large lake. New information from Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, published in the journal Nature, shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet. The explanation is that the substance perchlorate has been found in the soil, which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice, but is liquid and present in very salty water. Curiosity detected salts called perchlorates, which can absorb water from the atmosphere and turn it into briny liquid. When night falls, some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost, but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water, so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid. Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 in the large crater, Gale, located just south of the equator. The giant crater is 154 kilometres in diameter and the rim of the crater is almost five kilometres high. In the middle of the crater lies the mountain, Mount Sharp. Curiosity has travelled more than 10km from the landing site towards Mount Sharp and has carried out many studies along the way. Doctor Morten Bo Madsen, associate professor and head of the Mars Group at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: 'We have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and, under the right conditions, it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere. 'Our measurements from the Curiosity rover's weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter. 'Based on measurements of humidity and the temperature at a height of 1.6 metres and at the surface of the planet, we can estimate the amount of water that is absorbed. 'When night falls, some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost, but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water, so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid. Researchers say that Gale Crater was once a giant lake on the red planet . 'The soil is porous, so what we are seeing is that the water seeps down through the soil. 'Over time, other salts may also dissolve in the soil and now that they are liquid, they can move and precipitate elsewhere under the surface.' Observations by the Mars probe's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing, running water with a depth of up to one metre. Now the new close-up images taken by the rover all the way en route to Mount Sharp show that there are expanses of sedimentary deposits, lying as 'plates' one above the other and leaning a bit toward Mount Sharp. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, and before this study, scientists believed liquid water could not exist on its surface. In June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September of the same year, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Last month, scientists provided the best estimates for water on Mars, claiming it once had more liquid H2) than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years. The findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry. Dr Madsen said: 'These kind of deposits are formed when large amounts of water flow down the slopes of the crater and these streams of water meet the stagnant water in the form of a lake.' However, he added that it is not likely that life will be found on Mars as it is too dry, too cold and the cosmic radiation is so powerful that it penetrates at least one metre into the surface and kills all life - at least life as we know it on Earth. The finding, however, could make it easier for humans to live on Mars in the future. He explains that about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars had 6.5 times as much water as it does now and a thicker atmosphere. But most of this water has disappeared out into space and the reason is that Mars no longer has global magnetic fields, which we have on Earth. Observations by the Mars probe's stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing, running water with a depth of up to one metre. Currents of liquid iron in the Earth's interior generate the magnetic fields and they act as a shield that protects us from cosmic radiation. The magnetic field protects the Earth's atmosphere against degradation from energy rich particles from the sun. But Mars no longer has a global magnetic field and this means that the atmosphere is not protected from radiation from the sun, so the solar particles (protons) simply 'shoot' the atmosphere out into space little by little.",100,32,"earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","water, river, lake, bridge, walker, valley, flood, dry, rivers, flooding,","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","flooding, lake is dry, bridge, the water in the river has never been so high, flooded river","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","This topic is about flooding, dry lake, bridge, high levels of water in the river, and a flooded river.","Nasa,s describe global climate change on mars planet.In form of ice of water.No life on mars.Carbon emission atmosphere on mars.",Mars water indicate brokage of flood through dams.Mars is not save from sun ray light.Mars has quality of flooded river and dry lake.

Climate specialist Don White from WeatherWatch Australia confirmed that severe weather warnings were issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on Sunday. However, although they knew it would occur somewhere around the southeast coast, they did not know exactly where. 'The storm was forecast to form between Port Macquarie and Newcastle - that's as about as accurate as they could have predicted. But it turned out to hit closer to Newcastle than Port Macquarie,' Mr White told Daily Mail Australia. 'It all depends on exactly where it forms. This one formed in the worst possible spot, which was just north of Newcastle. It then covered 150km south from Newcastle to Wollongong where a third of Australia's population live. Scroll down for video . A tree and power lines lie across a major road in Raymond Terrace, 50km north of Sydney . A large gum tree (left) that has been uprooted on a property at Booragul, a suburb near Lake Macquarie north of Sydney in NSW. Powerful winds on Monday night and Tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding (right) in Edgecliff, in Sydney's eastern suburbs . A chart from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows the forecast for wind speed across New South Wales on Tuesday night . The Hunter Valley was one of the worst-hit areas in NSW and this car in the town of Blacksmiths got the brunt of the weather . 'So it was always going to be very destructive. It's not like it hit a few small fishing villages like a storm did on the south coast a few weeks ago.' Mr White also explained that those trying to forecast the weather had an even more difficult job now as there was not as much resources for them to call on and get the specific information they need. 'Our problem now is that any information that we can get from the upper atmosphere, which is where the cold air exists that initiates these types of conditions, is reliant on predicting satellite imagery,' Mr White told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't send up as many weather balloons any more, because of budget cuts so it'll affect what can be forecast. 'It's just economics. Weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places because of budget cuts, so there's not as many going up every day which means we don't get the same data as before from the upper atmosphere.' Mr White added that this information does not normally make a big difference, but it does in the storm season, because you can forecast thunder storms more accurately and pinpoint more accurately where these storms will be. 'But basically this was fairly well forecasted 24 to 48 hours ahead. The forecast was basically wet and windy but the actual intensity of these things is impossible to predict,' he says. 'This storm has also lasted a bit longer and hasn't moved. Normally it's 12 hours of severe weather and then it eases off. But this severe weather is lasting from 24 to 36 hours.' Emergency services admitted on Tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm and that their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly. Asked on ABC's 7.30 programme if warning systems had failed, NSW State Emergency Services deputy commissioner Steve Pearce said: 'The weather system did change very rapidly. 'This was an east coast low initially which are always historically very severe weather system however they come in and they go very quickly, this didn't. This has just stayed and tracked, again we have never seen these cyclonic winds last for 24 hours straight that's what's caused the majority of the damage.'

The cyclone strength winds currently battering the NSW coast are being caused by an intense low-pressure system known as an East Coast Low. The stormy weather system, formed in the Tasman Sea, hasn't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever. But why was everyone taken so by surprise? East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter. They are characterised by gales or storm force winds that can damage buildings, fell trees and powerlines, cause powerful surf that can damage the coast and, in some cases, run ships aground. They can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain, causing flash flooding and riverine flooding. Mr White told Daily Mail Australia: 'It forms occasionally, usually once a year. But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm.' Fire rescue in Narrabeen, in Sydney's northern suburbs, were called to a number of properties where storms had brought down trees . Ferry services have been cancelled at Parramatta (pictured) while services between Manly and Circular Quay have also been stopped . 'This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one,' Mr White said. 'They normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24- 36 hours, which is unusually long for an East Coast Low.' East Coast Lows draw strong, moisture-laden winds across the coast, which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast. On Monday night 24 Sydney suburbs incurred 100mm of rainfall, with Blacktown hit hardest, thanks to the latest East Coast Low. An estimated 100,000 homes are without power on Tuesday morning across Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter region. Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast, causing this tree to fall on a car in East Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, on Monday with a driver and passenger inside. They were treated for only minor injuries. They were treated for minor injuries by paramedics. The SES is preparing for damaging winds to hit parts of NSW over the next two days . A pedestrian is drenched while crossing the street in the Sydney central business district during heavy rain on Monday . And a floodwater rescue operation is underway in Hunter area where there have been wind gusts of up to 125km/h - levels recorded in category two cyclones. State Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner Steve Pearce told the ABC on Tuesday the police and NSW Fire and Rescue had been called in to help the SES on the 2400 call-outs they've received so far, with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes. 'We've had 24 hours of relentless gale-force winds. I haven't seen this wind damage for years,' Mr Pearce said. Some have speculated this week's East Coast Low will be the worst in five years, while meteorologist with Weatherzone Rob Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'This is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring.' 'The last major one that has affected Newcastle was in 2007. East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s,' Mr White said. A ship makes its way out to sea in Sydney on Monday. The Bureau of Meteorology has been issued for Sydney Closed Waters, the Hunter Coast, Sydney Coast, Illawarra Coast, Batemans Coast and Eden Coast . The SES had responded to about 15 jobs on Monday morning, mainly in Sydney metro area . 'If it is to the north of Newcastle the max effect occurs all the way down to Wollongong, which is in the vicinity of the nation where most people live so it causes the most damage.' In June 2007 bulk carrier Pasha Bulker ran aground near Newcastle amid wind gusts up to 124km/h. Other notable east coast lows occurred in October 2004, when there were mean wave heights off Sydney of 5m with a maximum height of about 10m. In August 1998, more than 300mm of rain fell over four days in Sydney and Illawarra, 420mm at Beaumont and 401mm at Kangaroo Valley. In May 1974, 165km/h gust at the Newcastle Nobbies saw bulk carrier the Sygna run aground. And in August 1857, the Dunbar wrecked at South Head killing 121, with only one person surviving.

The Arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 1,056 matches since his appointment in September 1996, has lifted the lid on his pre-match rituals in an interview with the official Arsenal Magazine. Wenger said: 'I always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game, but there's always a doubt on one or two. Arsene Wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his Arsenal team . Wenger lifts the FA Cup following Arsenal's triumph over Hull City at Wembley last season . 'You try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. 'When two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference. 'I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then I make my decision.' But even though the Frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after Arsenal's FA Cup win last season . Wenger said: 'Anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line-up will be. 'You live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day. 'If you don't know on Friday night, you will not know on Saturday morning so you have to decide in your head early, and go for it.'

British holidaymakers look set for cheaper European holidays after the pound hit its highest level against the euro for more than seven years. Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 ‚ giving British families more 'bang for their buck' on the Continent. The latest surge was seen as a vote of confidence in the British economy at a time when the euro is tumbling on global currency markets. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing. A British family now changing £500 would get 70 euros more than they would have done just six months ago and more than 120 euros more than two years ago. Simon Philips, head of retail at travel money specialist No 1 Currency, said: 'A tumbling euro means power to your pound. 'British holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this Easter will enjoy rates not seen since pre-credit crunch.' Figures from Travelex show £500 would now buy 680 euros compared with 610 euros six months ago, 589 euros a year ago and 559 euros two years ago. The rise in the value of the pound against the euro has made everything from hotel rooms and car hire to food and drinks on the Continent cheaper for British families. Some experts believe sterling could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months as the British economy leaves the struggling eurozone in its wake. David Swann, head of pricing at currency exchange experts Travelex, said: 'The pound is clearly on a winning streak at the moment, having struck another fresh high against the euro. With the pound up 16 per cent against the euro compared to last year, it's going to make a big difference to the Brits who are now booking their Easter and summer holidays.' The euro has been in decline for months but the sell-off accelerated this week after the European Central Bank started printing money through quantitative easing in a bid to kick-start growth across the region. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing . The situation in Greece ‚ where the new Left-wing government is struggling to win support from its European paymasters over fresh emergency funding ‚ has also driven the euro lower. Although a strong pound is a boon for British holidaymakers, it can hinder UK exporters by making the goods they sell overseas more expensive for foreign buyers. Harry Adams, managing director of currency specialist Argentex, said the pound could hit 1.55 euros before the end of the year ‚ a level not seen since mid-2002. 'The euro bashing continues and I would be wary to predict when this will end,' he said. 'Investors are very wary of holding euros with the recent implementation of quantitative easing and the uncertainty over Greece. There are far safer currencies to hold such as the dollar and pound, forcing these rates higher and higher.' The pound's rally was not mirrored on the stock market in London where shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since October last year. The FTSE 100 index closed down 173.63 points at 6702.84 ‚ wiping £44billion off the value of Britain's leading companies. Analysts blamed worries about Greece and the wider global economy including a slowdown in China. Speculation that the Federal Reserve, America's powerful central bank, could raise interest rates in the world's biggest economy this summer also hit sentiment.

Aaron Schock billed taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall, including a trip on a private jet to a Chicago Bears football game. The flights last November don't include more than a dozen other trips on donors' planes that Schock has paid for out of his House office expenses or campaign funds since joining Congress in 2009. Schock, a 33-year-old Republican representing Peoria, had already been facing scrutiny for using congressional funds to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show 'Downton Abbey.' He repaid those charges last month out of his own pocket; his office had said it's reviewing other expenses. Rep. Aaron Schockis accused of billing taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall that included a trip to a Chicago Bears football game . Schock and his entourage flew in an Eclipse 500 aircraft like this one . The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday night that Schock flew from Peoria, Illinois to Chicago to attend a Bears game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 16, 2014 . Overall, according to the paper, he used $20,855 in taxpayer money for the Chicago trip and another to New York in September, where his political action committee spent another $3,000 for tickets to the Global Citizen Festival concert. This week Schock reportedly hired a pair of lawyers to audit his political and legislative operations. Spokesmen for Schock declined to comment to the Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune, and did not respond to a request from Daily Mail Online. In a statement last week they said a legal team was already poring over 'compliance procedures in his official office, campaign and leadership PAC to determine whether they can be improved.' The football game was part of a longer trip on a chartered six-seat business jet that took off from a civil aviation airport in Manassas, Virginia en route to Peoria on a Friday. The Bears defeated the Vikings but the game may ultimately defeat a congressman . DOWNTON OFFICE: Schock spent $40,000 in taxpayer funds redecorating his Capitol Hill office, but had to pay the money back . The Sunday trip was a sideline before the aircraft returned to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport a day later. All the seats were filled, according to pilot Keith Siilats, who told the Sun-Times that Schock's district director Dayne LaHood and three others were aboard. He also said he accompanied the congressman and his group to the football game. He was paid $10,802 for 'commercial transportation' in November, the last month for which numbers are available.

The patient's status was changed from serious to critical condition, meaning the person's condition has apparently worsened. The patient is being treated at the National Institutes of Health's hospital near Washington, D.C. The patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane last week and arrived early on Friday morning. The patient's name, age and gender have not been released.

Five people in the U.S. are now being monitored after being exposed to Ebola . The person is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization. The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November. This came as a second American health care worker who was possibly exposed to Ebola has been moved to Nebraska Medicine's biocontainment unit after a change in symptoms, the hospital said on Monday. The worker was one of four monitored in Nebraska after exposure to another American who tested positive for Ebola. The person who was moved has not tested positive for the virus, the hospital said. None of the patients has been identified. The hospital said it would receive a fifth person who was part of the initial exposure in Sierra Leone later on Monday. The latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill. The man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia. He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals. The World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease. While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring. That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday. On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda. One of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release on Monday. However, none of those being monitored has tested positive for Ebola. The National Institutes of Health said it has no other pending admissions of additional patients with the Ebola virus or who have been exposed to Ebola. CDC workers in Sierra Leone are involved in investigating the illness of the first patient, including looking for other people the person was in contact with.

The target: Sequestration cuts expected to take effect in 2016 that, officials say, will threaten U.S. air superiority. Air Force Secretary Deborah James told lawmakers last month that ""enough is enough"" when it comes to downsizing the Air Force, defending President Obama's $534 billion Pentagon base budget request to the defense appropriations subcommittee. ""Given the state of the world ... the No. 1 thing we have to stop is this downsizing,"" James said. Despite the concerns of defense officials, lawmakers insisted that $10 billion will need to be cut from the Air Force's portion of the President's proposed budget, which, in total, exceeds spending caps by nearly $35 billion. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, called the President's base budget ""a fantasy"" but expressed a desire to find a bipartisan compromise to provide some relief from spending caps instituted in 2013 after budget disagreements between President Obama and Congress. Until a compromise is reached, Cole said the committee will have to make ""a lot of tough decisions"" related to cutting billions from the Air Force's spending request. But will cuts actually threaten the United States' standing as the most modern and capable air fleet on the planet? Despite writing the blueprint on how to build the world's greatest air force, Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force's chief of staff, says the United States will not be able to maintain the Air Force's strategic gains once next year's sequestration cuts take effect. He says other nations are now using the U.S. model to build their own air fleets, a trend that could degrade the strategic advantage U.S. air superiority provides to the military. However, some experts say that downsizing the Air Force and even cutting its budget won't necessarily threaten U.S. air dominance. Jerry Hendrix, the director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the Center for a New American Security and a former Navy captain, says the United States is still comfortably ahead of every other nation in terms of overall air capabilities. Despite the fact that the U.S. Air Force has a quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago, it is still larger than the air forces of the next seven countries combined, said Hendrix. It is also the only nation with an operational fifth-generation fighter jet. Air Force officials argue that the force is currently older and smaller than it has ever been and that further budget cuts would hinder its ability to modernize and maintain effective command structure. ""The option of not modernizing isn't really an option at all,"" Welsh said. ""Air forces that fall behind the technology curve and joint forces without the full breadth of air, space and cyber power ... will lose."" The irony lies in that the Air Force's emphasis on investing in a fleet solely made up of high-end aircraft may be one of the key factors drawing down the size of the force, says Hendrix. He agrees that more spending should be shifted toward air and maritime power due to their increasing roles in U.S. military strategy but says mistakes were made in terms of how the Air Force has balanced its commitment to maintaining the size of the fleet with its desire to modernize. ""Air Force leadership has failed to balance the idea that quantity has a quality of its own,"" he said, adding that the Air Force should still pursue high-end aircraft but should supplement the fleet with older, cheaper aircraft models, like the F-16, for low-end operations instead of immediately phasing them out when a new generation is introduced. In order for the Air Force to maintain air superiority, Hendrix says, officials and lawmakers need to start having a real conversation about the best way to mitigate downsizing that also promotes modernization. Then they need to work out a budget and find a way to work within it.",134,162,"air, plane, aircraft, flight, flying, pilot, fly, jet, crew, landing,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","flying the plane, the pilot of this aircraft, passengers flying for leisure or work, landing strip, the flight crew, take-offs and landings, aircraft landing, jet flying by","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about flying the plane, the pilot of the aircraft, passengers flying for leisure or work, landing strip, the flight crew, take-offs and landings, aircraft landing, and a jet flying by.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",This article I mainly talking about the debate surrounding the downsizing of the military budget and specifically the lack of new modern planes for the Air Force to fly. It sounds like the best solution would be to focus on building better planes to fly but also keeping the older ones for smaller missions. This would let the budget downsize without losing air superiority.,President Obama who was president during this article was taking heat from the Republican Party for trying to downsize the Air Force budget. Republican senators from Arkansas and Oklahoma specifically were against the downsize but hoping for compromise.

An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers.

In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.'

Rachel Lehnardt, 35, had been a life-long follower of the Mormon church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband James, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Iraq, her lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. But following their divorce last year, she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church, where she had once been a Sunday school teacher, the lawyer said. Her alcohol abuse culminated in the startling incident in which she allegedly allowed her daughter and her friends to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in front of her at their Evans, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, is pictured walking outside her Georgia home on Wednesday, several days after she was arrested for allegedly throwing a drunken party for her teenage daughter . She had already been drunk when her 16-year-old daughter returned with her friends, according to her lawyer, Shawn Hammond. According to authorities, Lehnardt and the teenagers then played naked Twister - although Lehnardt left halfway through the game to have sex with an 18-year-old man in the bathroom. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, Augusta Crime reported. After going to bed, she awoke around 3.30am to find her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend raping her and immediately threw him off, according to Hammond. The girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10-inch penis was too big for her, so he had to have sex with her mom instead, according to a police report. According to Hammond, Lehnardt woke the next day and realized that her drinking had got out of hand and had led to her being raped by the 16-year-old. Her daughter has now split from the boy. Video from KJBF . Arrested: Lehnardt, pictured in her mug shot, was arrested after she told her AA sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities. Lehnardt said she is working to put it behind her . Split: Her lawyer said Lehnardt, who is a life-long Mormon, turned to drink after divorcing from her husband James Lehnardt, pictured right. He returned from Iraq with PTSD and was later discharged, the lawyer said . After the incident, the children's paternal grandparents found out about the party from the teenage girl and were awarded custody of the five children. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in religious activity, which is constitutionally protected. Lehnardt's lawyer said she was shocked with what had happened so she researched local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and met with a sponsor, named Heidi, who encouraged Lehnardt to tell her about her divorce, her drinking and the incident that led to her losing her children. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend, and admitted to being a porn addict. Heidi then went to authorities and told them what the mother-of-five had confessed to doing at the party. Lehnardt's lawyer called Heidi's decision to go to the sheriff's office 'unfortunate'. Lehnardt was arrested last Saturday and charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hammond, the lawyer, released a statement shared by Augusta Crime on Thursday, saying Lehnardt was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened. 'Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct,' he said. 'Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.' He denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs, and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities. 'Mrs. Lehnardt has recommitted herself to her faith and her family,' he continued. 'She is hopeful that her children, members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated.' He did not comment on the naked Twister, bathroom sex or sex toy allegations, and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated. Denial: The mother-of-five said she did not throw the party but did admit to witnessing teenagers smoke marijuana. She also claimed she later awoke to her daughter's teenage boyfriend raping her . Scene: After the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, she lost custody of her five children . Downcast: Her lawyer said she has been a life-long Mormon who only recently started drinking alcohol . Before the divorce, she had never consumed alcohol, drugs or caffeine, he said. She married her husband, James, in 2000 and they had five children together, now aged between four and 16. James Lehnardt served with an artillery unit in Iraq during one of his deployments where he held the rank of specialist. He was based in Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from July 2009 as part of Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 17th Fires Brigade, Brigade Aviation Element. The unit, part of the 7th Division, co-ordinated American and Iraqi security force missions in the south of Iraq after British forces left and American troops were deployed there to deal with the Shi'ite militia which took control of the city. He was later based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Tacoma, Washington and more recently, the Augusta-Fort Gordon area of Georgia. But due to his PTSD and anger issues, he was ultimately discharged and is now on VA disability, according to Mrs Lehnardt's lawyer. According to her sponsor, who went to police, she also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . Neighborhood: She was already drunk when her daughter and her friends came back to the neighborhood, pictured, because they had been staying at their father's, she said . The couple separated in 2014 and she kept custody of the children. She also returned to work, where she struggled while earning just above minimum wage, he explained. Around this time, she started drinking at the weekends when she didn't have the children and it ultimately got out of hand, leading to the incident at their Evans home, her lawyer said. Following her arrest on Saturday, she posted $3,200 bond and was released from the Columbia County Detention Center. While Lehnardt said she had been raped by the teenage boy, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. This week, she was seen outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes, and looking downcast.

It has serious implications for the way we live right now.'

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches.

A 'wicked' daughter who stole £20,000 from her dementia-stricken mother and spent it on herself instead of paying care home fees has been spared jail. Hilary Border, 54, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, had power of attorney over her 83-year-old mother Dorothy's affairs when her health deteriorated. The mother-of-three was required to pay £300-a-week for the 83-year-old's care but when it doubled to £600 the money was either late or stopped being paid at all. Care home staff tried to contact Border over an outstanding £16,000 debt over two years before reporting her to police. She pleaded guilty to fraud on the basis she took £20,000 between October 2012, and November 20 last year, despite the fact that prosecution said it was £39,500. Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday. Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'You stole money from your mum. You were trusted to be her power of attorney to deal with her money. 'It was wicked to steal from someone who was in a care home. 'The owners of the care home seem to have taken pity on your mum. Others might not have been so charitable. 'She has dementia and doesn't appreciate the wickedness of her daughter, how you have betrayed her trust and stolen her money.' Border was also made subject of an eight-month home curfew and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard Border's mother suffered from angina, sclerosis of the liver and seriously low blood pressure. Defence attorney Ian Way said Border had taken a small amount of money to ease financial pressures in her own life and the fraud had then escalated. He added: 'She is 54, of good character.

The Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection ended Saturday night at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, who rallied for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four at Indianapolis. They will meet four-time national champ Duke in Monday night's title game. The Blue Devils dominated Michigan State 81-61 in the first contest of the night. National player of the year finalist Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Junior forward Sam Dekker added 16 points. ""These guys just gutted it out.,"" Wisconsin Head Coach Bo Ryan said. ""We just kept battling on every possession."" Freshman Karl-Anthony Towns led Kentucky with 16 points. Sophomore Andrew Harrison chipped in 13 points while Aaron Harrison had 12 points. Kentucky came into the game as the first men's team to have a 38-0 record. But the Badgers fought back from a 60-56 deficit with 6:39 left in the game. Wisconsin went on an 8-0 run to regain a lead it never relinquished. It will be looking to win its first title since 1941. As the final minutes ticked off, the Wildcats failed to score. They were stuck on 60 for five minutes. The Harrison twins, who shot well in the first half, couldn't get much done offensively. ""I didn't execute. I mean, we didn't execute as a team, but me being the point guard, I didn't do what coach told me to on a couple of occasions,"" Andrew Harrison said at the postgame news conference. His coach sternly interjected. ""He did fine. He did fine,"" John Calipari said. Meanwhile, Dekker stepped up, making a layup, a three-pointer and a free throw as the Badgers scooted ahead. Calipari said the Badgers did a good job defending the Kentucky big men. ""They crowded us a little bit, and (our) guys got a little tentative,"" he said. Calipari looked at the stat sheet: Kentucky had only six turnovers, hit 90% of its free throws, made 48% of its field goals, and lost. He said his team struggled to guard Wisconsin's players, and the rebound battle -- which Wisconsin won by 12 -- was crucial. Kamisky, who turned 22 on Saturday, was asked how the Badgers outrebounded a team that is the tallest in basketball. ""We stayed into them, attacking them, trying to do whatever we can,"" he said. ""Just trying to keep them off the glass was one of our main priorities."" Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points while national freshman of the year Jahlil Okafor had 18 points, 10 of which came in the first half. Senior guard Quinn Cook had 17. ""The defense was terrific,"" Duke Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ""We drove the ball with such strength. I actually think our offense gave our defense a push."" Junior guard Denzel Valentine sparked the Spartans with three early three-pointers and finished with 22 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Senior guard Travis Trice had 16 points. The Spartans, of the Big Ten, began the game in a higher gear than Duke, and quickly took an eight-point lead. But after Valentine hit his trio of long-range shots and Michigan State led 14-6, the Spartans struggled to get baskets the rest of the first half. ""They did a good job of denying us and forcing us out (farther from the basket). We took some bad shots,"" Valentine said. Duke occasionally used a 2-3 zone defense that protected some of its players with foul concerns and slowed the Spartans down. But it was when Duke played man-to-man that the Spartans really had a hard time scoring. State made five of its first seven shots, then only made three more in the final 16 minutes of the opening half. The Blue Devils, of the Atlantic Coast Conference, found baskets inside as the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Okafor powered for points around the basket. Winslow used his quickness to score seven points in the first half, but he only played 12 minutes because he committed two fouls. Duke led at halftime 36-25, a turnaround of 19 points from its early deficit. ""Coach always stresses that great defense leads to great offense,"" Cook said. The confidence gained in getting defensive stops led to the desire for Duke players to drive the lane instead of shooting three-pointers. ""We saw seams that we could take advantage of,"" Cook said. In the second half, Duke increased its lead to 20 points, then cruised home. The Spartans were never able to cut the deficit to single digits and Duke sank its free throws in the final minutes. ""We got beat and ... Duke played awfully well, but I thought it wasn't one of our better games,"" Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. The Blue Devils apparently like playing in Final Fours in Indianapolis, home of the NCAA. It won titles there in 1991 and 2010. The other two crowns came in 1992 and 2001, each in Minneapolis.

In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.",113,128,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","Progressive women's groups have marked Tuesday as a fictitious holiday Equal Pay Day as the point in the year when women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called pay gap.

Betheny Coyne, from Wigan, Lancashire, was diagnosed with a rare heart defect before she was born - and was never expected to reach her fourth birthday. But she defied medical predictions and now, aged 24, she is mother to three healthy children. This is despite being warned that each pregnancy could have placed so much extra strain on her heart that she would die. Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year.

Miss Coyne said: 'If I didn't have my children or my fianc, Mark, I'd spend my life worrying I was going to die. 'I can't have any more surgery on my heart so it's a case of living with my heart defect and ensuring I do everything I want to in life while I can. 'I have defied doctors by getting this far - so we just take every day as it comes and try to take pictures of everything. 'I just want to make sure that the kids are happy and that we make lots of memories as a family as I know my condition makes me a ticking time bomb.' Miss Coyne was born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby. The condition makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body due to a narrowed aorta, the main artery that leaves the left side of the heart. The risk is that it may narrow further at any time, meaning the blood will stop going round the body properly, and in turn cause complete heart failure. Miss Coyne's parents were first told their daughter had a heart defect before she was born, but it was only later scans that revealed the true extent of the rare condition. Due to her uncertain life expectancy, Bethany wore a heart monitor to school and went for regular check-ups. She still has to go for an ultrasound scan every six months to check her heart health. Miss Coyne (with partner Mark) was born with born with a heart condition known as coarctation of the aorta, which caused her need open heart surgery three times as a baby.

Fearing her heart is like a 'ticking time bomb ', she is determined to make as many memories as possible with her family, and will be getting married in February next year after getting engaged on holiday last year . She said: 'I worry every time I go for an appointment about what they are going to say, it's a constant uncertainty. 'Growing up with the condition was difficult because it felt so unfair that I was going into hospital all of the time for tests and check-ups while other children didn't have to. 'The possibility of dying at any moment didn't really affect me until I had children. 'You just get on with life when it's just you, but when you have kids you have more responsibility and something to live for.

'It was only when I was told I probably shouldn't have children that I realised how much I wanted to have them. I knew I'd regret it if I never became a mum.' She became pregnant with her first child, Haley, unexpectedly when she was 19 - and before she met her now fianc, Mark. She had previously been warned by her heart specialist that having children would cause a massive strain on her heart. She said: 'I was really worried when I fell pregnant, but I tried to live as normal a life as possible and focused on the baby.' Thankfully, her heart condition is not genetic, so there was little chance of her passing it onto her children. Speakiing about giving birth to her daughter in 2009, she said: 'I was so relieved. When I gave birth it went so well - it was completely normal.' The following year, she met her fianc Mark Brimble, 35, in a local bar . Aware of the seriousness of her condition, she told him about it early on in the relationship.

Mr Brimble then proposed last May while they were on holiday and baby Harper arrived in the December. Miss Coybe said: 'We don't want any more children - the main thing now is having a great time with the three we have. 'Before Harper was born we took the girls to Disneyland Paris for Haley's fourth birthday and we had the best time. However there are constant reminders of her condition. At times, breathing can be very difficult and there are days when she feels exhausted. She said: 'Mark is an amazing dad, so I would have no worries about the children if I died.' June Davidson, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Years of research has helped to dramatically improve survival rates for babies born with congenital heart defects from a position where very few babies survived to one where almost all do.'

Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are ""conscientious objectors,"" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new ""no jab, no pay"" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. ""The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,"" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. ""It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations.

Malia Obama, 16, is already visiting colleges in preparation for when she heads to school in the fall of 2016. She hasn't even finished high school, but President Obama said the thought of her heading off to college has him crying on a daily basis.

Can't let her go: The 11th grade student (left) is already visiting schools and will go to college in the fall of 2016 . So sad: President Obama said he's 'sad' and he 'starts tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it' He said on Tuesday during the Easter Prayer Breakfast: 'I start tearing up in the middle of the day and I can't explain it, why am I so sad? 'They're leaving me.' The 11th grade student, who attends the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., has already visited at UC Berkeley, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Yale and Wesleyan, the Washington Post reported. Malia's younger sister Sasha, 13, won't start thinking about college for a few years yet. Obama continued: 'I want to thank everybody here for their prayers, which means so much to me and Michelle, particularly at a time when my daughters are starting to grow up and starting to go on college visits. 'I need prayer.' Thankfully: Malia's (right) younger sister Sasha, 13 (center), won't start thinking about college for a few years yet . If Malia attends Columbia for an undergraduate degree, she will be following in her father's footsteps. However, based on comments he made in February when he addressed a cybersecurity summit on Stanford's campus in Palo Alto, California, President Obama might want his daughter to go there. President Obama said of Stanford: 'I've got to admit, like, I kind of want to go here. 'I was trying to figure out why it is that a really nice place like this is wasted on young people who don't fully appreciate what you got. 'It's really nice. And everybody here is so friendly and smart, and it's beautiful. And what's there not to like?' 'Let's face it, I like Stanford grads.'

A Washington Post journalist who has been detained in Iran for eight months has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security', according to an Iranian news agency. Iranian officials announced in January that Jason Rezaian, who is the Post's Tehran bureau chief, would stand trial before the country's Revolutionary Court to face 'security charges', but did not elaborate what those charges were. The Fars news agency did not reveal the source for their information, but the agency is considered to be close to the ultra conservative Iran hard-liners. The report alleges that Rezaian, 39, obtained economic and industrial information from the country and then sold it to unnamed Americans. Rezaian was also linked to Omid Memarian, a US-based Iranian opposition journalist, in the report. Fars claimed that 'selling Iran's economic and industrial information at a time of sanctions is exactly like selling food at a time of war'. Iran is subject to sanctions from the U.S, Europe and the United Nations due to its nuclear program. In the Washington Post, executive editor Martin Baron called the allegations a 'farce and a sham'. 'Seven months have passed without Iranian legal authorities publicly outlining the allegations against Jason,' he said. 'Now we have someone outside the judiciary system making outlandish allegations that come with no evidence. This isn't justice.' Leila Ahsan, Rezaian's lawyer, would not comment on the specific charges that have been brought against her client but said she has studied the text of the indictment and will brief his family in the upcoming days. Ashan said she visited the journalist in prison last month and that he appeared to be 'in good health and spirits'. 'I can see him anytime,' she said. 'Jason asked me to provide a strong defense. I'm in constant touch with his wife and family. I've requested that the court hold the trial as soon as possible.' An Iranian news agency considered to be close to Iran hard-liners claims that Rezaian (pictured with his wife Yaganeh Salehi) has been accused of 'espionage' and 'acting against national security' Rezaian and his wife, Iranian-born Yeganeh Salehi, were taken from their Tehran home on July 22 and detained with two photojournalists. All were released except for American-born Rezaian, who has dual citizenship that is not recognized by Iran. Rezaian was not allowed to hire a lawyer until seven months after he was first arrested. His family was also not permitted from hiring Masoud Shafiei, who was their first choice for Rezaian's attorney because of his experience with representing imprisoned foreigners and dual citizens. Shafiei was forbidden from taking the case by the judiciary for unspecified reasons, according to the New York Times. Last month President Barack Obama called on the Iranian government to immediately release Rezaian as well as two other detained Americans, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati.",195,162,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","On charges of espionage, a Washington Post journalist was arrested by the Iranian government.

The average profit that energy firms are making from customers has surged to an all-time high of £118 a household. This is up by a third on last year and well over double the £49 the companies were making two years ago. The rise is a direct result of firms failing to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale price they pay for gas and electricity. The industry regulator Ofgem estimates that the average wholesale cost of gas and electricity is down from £633 per household a year ago to £553 ‚ an £80 drop. But its figures for household dual-fuel bills show a lower fall of £60, taking them to an average of £1,295 a year ‚ of which nearly 10 per cent is profit. The Big Six firms ‚ British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power ‚ have been able to cash in by keeping their tariffs high during winter. They have announced small reductions of around 5 per cent or less, but this will make little difference to household bills. The apparent profiteering comes despite the fact that last year was one of the warmest on record and total household consumption of gas and electricity was down by 14 per cent on 2013. It will add to demands for a shake-up amid claims that suppliers are failing to compete on price and customer service. The Competition and Markets Authority is asking suppliers to explain why lower wholesale costs have not been passed on and Which? wants a new regime for setting energy prices. The consumer group suggests regulators should set a fair 'price to beat' based on an assessment of costs, and firms would compete to match or undercut it. A charting showing the decreasing wholesale energy costs and the increasing pre-tax margin for the energy giants . Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: 'Consumers will be questioning why their bills haven't been slashed further at a time of rising profits and falling wholesale prices. Energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern, so we need the CMA to get to the bottom of whether the price people pay is right. We also need to see simple pricing, and a price to beat that people can trust.' Citizens Advice said: 'Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits while barely cutting energy prices.' Energy companies reject the way Ofgem estimates profits. Lawrence Slade, of the trade body Energy UK, said: 'Ofgem risks misleading customers by publishing these inaccurate figures every month.' The firms have suggested part of the blame for high bills should fall on Ed Miliband and his vow to impose a price freeze if Labour wins the election. Executives suggest they are unwilling to cut prices because they are afraid of being locked into low tariffs that would put their profits at risk. Wholesale gas and electricity costs are expected to be £80 less than they were estimated at a year ago .",13,55,"price, cost, products, market, prices, sales, product, costs, companies, expensive,","energy, power, heat, plant, fuel, waste, plants, produce, solar, produced,","market prices and market sales, companies reducing costs, price tags dramatically undercut the major supermarkets, increased sales in the current market, determining a price point for this product, product sales","power plant, use fuel to produce heat, solar energy, fossil fuels produce waste","This topic is about market prices and market sales, companies reducing costs, price tags dramatically undercut the major supermarkets, increased sales in the current market, determining a price point for a product, and product sales.","This topic is about power plants, using fuel to produce heat, fossil fuels that produce waste, and solar energy.",Electricity costs in Britain have risen despite lower fossil fuel cost.

111,3ZAZR5XV03KMGXYK39U6HKNPCPVCZP,6f331c7895519ab732e64fdbcb0abe86d303f64a,"The majority of heatwaves and almost a fifth of extreme rain storms can be blamed on human activity, a new study has warned. Researchers say that three quarters of extreme hot weather and 18 per cent of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming that has occurred due to man-made emissions. They warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher over the coming decades, humans will become responsible for 40 per cent of extreme rainfall events. Researchers say 75% of extreme hot weather and 18% of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming as a result of man-made emissions. They warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher, humans will be responsible for 40% of extreme rainfall events (floods in Somerset in 2014 are shown) The scientists claim it is the rarest and most destructive events that seem to be the most responsive to human influence. Dr Erich Fischer, from the institute for atmospheric and climate science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who led the study, said: 'Climate change includes not only changes in mean climate but also in weather extremes. Global temperatures were the highest since records began in 1880, according to scientists. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8∞C (1.4∞F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office has already announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Scientists have also warned that 2015 could be warmer still. Earlier this month they revealed that the Earth experienced its hottest month of March since record-keeping began in 1880. The first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4∞F (13.6∞C), which is 1.5∞F (0.85∞C) above the average for the 20th century. Also of concern was the finding that Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for March. Much of the most abnormal heat has been in the Pacific Ocean and places near it. Seven western U.S. states set records for their hottest first three months of the year, while New York and Vermont set records for the coldest start of a year. Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia have also all been warmer than normal. Blunden blames the record heat on a combination of El Ni±o, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and human-caused climate change. 'With every degree of warming it is the rarest and the most extreme events and thereby the ones with typically the highest socio-economic impacts for which the largest fraction is due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. 'We show that at the present-day warming of 0.85∞C about 18 per cent of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times, which in turn primarily results from human influence. 'For 2∞C of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40 per cent. 'Likewise, today about 75 per cent of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Climate Change, examined the probability that heatwaves and heavy rainfall events could be attributed to humans using 25 climate models. The models examined the weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations. They analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate - referred to as moderate daily extremes. They then used the models to look at predictions of extreme weather between 2006 and 2100 under an emissions scenario that is expected to lead to 2∞C of warming around the world. While attributing individual extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves to climate change is notoriously difficult, climate scientists have predicted they will become more common as the world warms. Dr Fischer and his colleague Professor Reto Knutti, also based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, said taking a more global perspective made it easier to examine the role that human activity was having on such events. They say their research demonstrated a strong signal for human influence in the extreme weather that is having impacts around the world today. They found that the longer the period of the event - such as a heatwave, the greater the fraction is attributable to global warming. The graphic above shows where the change in the probability of heavy precipitation and heatwaves compared to the pre-industrial period. If global temperatures increase as predicted, as a result of climate change, this becomes more pronounced, explained the researchers . California is in the grip of its worst drought on record, causing lake beds to dry up (as above). Around three quarters of heatwaves can now be attributed to human activity and it is likely to worsen as the climate warms . Dr Fischer said: 'A warmer and moister atmosphere does clearly favour more frequent hot and wet extremes.' Professor Peter Stott, a scientist at the Met Office's Hadley Centre in the UK, pointed to the extreme weather that has happened in the past year - one of the warmest on record. He said Bangladesh was hit by flooding in 2014, Australia suffered heatwaves and Kenya was battered by downpours. California, for example, is in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record. He added that human-caused climate change had 'loaded the dice' in favour of heatwaves like the one that hit Europe in 2003 and the flooding that hit the UK in autumn 2000. The models examined weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations. They analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate. Extreme rainfall is pictured in London . Writing in the journal, Professor Stott said: 'As each year goes by, evidence continues to accumulate that our climate is changing and that human influence plays a dominant role in observed warming. 'The prevalence of extremely hot temperatures is expected to increase with warming and more moisture in the atmosphere leads to a tendency towards more extreme rainfall events, changes that have been detected in the observational record. 'But what has been lacking up to now is a robust calculation of how much more likely extreme temperatures and rainfall have become worldwide. 'The idea that in a two-degree world almost half of heavy rainfall events would not have occurred were it not for climate change is a sobering thought for policymakers seeking to mitigate and adapt to climate change.'",100,218,"earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","snow, weather, cold, winter, temperatures, conditions, hot, morning, expected, parts,","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","winter temperatures, hot weather conditions, a cold morning, snow is expected later","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","This topic is about winter temperatures as opposed to hot weather conditions, cold mornings, and weather forecasts like snow being expected later.","A new study has warned and blamed on human activities for the amount of heatwaves and almost a fifth of extreme rain storms.

The Holland striker's sharp performance at Craven Cottage suggests he will be in contention to start in Louis van Gaal's side for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Van Persie missed seven matches after injuring his ankle in mid-February and has only just returned to the first-team picture, replacing Wayne Rooney for the final two minutes of United's 3-0 loss at Everton on Sunday.

The primary aim of this appearance was to get much-needed minutes under his belt but his two goals had the added effect of sending United four points clear at the top of the Under-21 Premier League table. Van Persie was undoubtedly the star attraction, but the team fielded by Warren Joyce also included Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, Anders Lindegaard and Andreas Pereira. And it didn't take long for the visitors to assert their authority against a Fulham side threatened by relegation from the top tier at this level. On 13 minutes, Van Persie controlled a Pereira through ball just inside the 18-yard box and slotted past Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman to open the scoring.

Shameless Mike Holpin ‚ who at 56 says he wants more children ‚ claims he had them by 20 women and admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street. Now engaged again, the three-times married man keeps track of their names with an ever-growing family tree tattooed on his back. 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiance Diane, says he wants more children because it is 'God's will' His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children's mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: 'I'll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I'm doing what God wants.' Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin's claim to 40 children ‚ aged between three and 37 ‚ was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: 'Feeling Asshamed' (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. He added: 'I'm as fertile as sin. I don't believe in contraception and I love sex. Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they've suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I'm an alcoholic. I'm still an alcoholic ‚ I just don't practise it.' Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . TaxPayers' Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: 'It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.' But former friends say Mr Holpin's boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had 'padded' his numbers by including his ex-partner's stepchildren. He added: 'He's no angel after a drink but he isn't the big ladies' man that he likes to think he is. 'He's definitely had a football team's worth of little 'uns ‚ maybe 16 ‚ just because he's not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.' Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin's daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: 'You can all hate but it doesn't matter, there's plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. 'I feel like I can't even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn't ask my dad to do what he's done with his life.' Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Day out: Mike and Diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley . New life: The father-of-40 lives with his fiance Diane Morris, ten years his junior, and they live in a two-bed council house in South Wales. Mr Holpin's brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker's 'shocking' behaviour had brought 'shame' on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: 'I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago ‚ he didn't have a phone so we couldn't keep in touch. 'It wouldn't surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. I'm not ashamed of Michael, but I'm upset about the way our family name has been tarnished.

Chelsea football manager Jose Mourinho has revealed that he talks to God every day, but never about football and never discusses the game with his wife. The father-of-two said that he and his family 'know about poverty' and have been privileged to have worked with the Word Food Programme as an ambassador against hunger. The 52-year-old football manager said that he tries his best to separate his professional and his family life. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mourinho admitted that he has a strong faith in God. 'I believe totally, clearly. Every day I pray; every day I speak with Him. I don't go to the church every day, not even every week. I go when I feel I need to. And when I'm in Portugal, I always go.' The former Real Madrid manager said he only prays for things in is personal life, never about Chelsea. 'I can say the reality is I never go to the church to speak with Him about football. Never!' Despite his intensely arrogant persona on the sideline, Mourinho claims that he is a good person. 'I think so. I try to be. And I think I am. I don't have problems with family or friends. I am a good family person; I am a good friend. I try to support people that I don't even know. 'Do I make mistakes? Yes. My professional area is not only very competitive ‚ it is competitive and emotional and [you must] push people for a certain kind of behaviour ‚ absolutely, yes. But the professional life is only part of a person; a person is much more than that.' Chelsea are currently top of the league and are playing struggling QPR this weekend. Earlier this season, Mourinho was fined £25,000 by football authorities for claiming there was a 'campaign' against Chelsea after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton.

Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan ‚ stoking fears of a buy-to-let boom. The offer comes as pension reforms give over-55s access to billions of pounds from today to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they like. Tens of thousands of savers are being tempted to put their money into property ‚ and this surge of 'silver landlords' is likely to push up house prices. Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan, meaning some pensioners are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105 (file picture, posed) Traditionally, banks have been reluctant to allow borrowing beyond retirement, but now other lenders are considering raising their age limits too. Savers who want to put their money towards buy-to-let properties are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase a house outright, with the average price standing at £273,000. The option of taking out a mortgage to cover the shortfall has previously been unavailable as banks prefer people to repay before turning 70 or 75. But unlike residential mortgages, funded by income likely to fall away in retirement, a buy-to-let mortgage is funded by rental income, which does not cease when the owner retires. Economists say the increase in silver landlords competing to buy properties is boosting house prices, which are increasing at 8.4 per cent a year. Three in four of Britain's 2million landlords regard their property as their pension, according to research from financial consultancy BDRC. About one in five homes in Britain are owned by private landlords, and this is expected to rise to one in three by 2032, Government figures suggest. But there are perils too. The buy-to-let boom expected to follow today's changes could have painful tax consequences for some, experts warn. Withdrawing large sums from a pension pot will trigger a hefty income tax bill ‚ for example, taking out £150,000 will produce a £40,000 demand from HMRC. Buy-to-let homes also attract tax on rental income and capital gains tax if the property is later sold. And for ageing landlords, there is inheritance tax to consider too. Tens of thousands of savers who have had their pension released under today's new reforms are being tempted to put their money into property ‚ and this surge of 'silver landlords' is likely to push up house prices . Jane Vass of Age UK said: 'Although Age UK believes affordability not age should determine whether someone is given a loan, using your pension fund to pay the deposit could have significant tax and financial consequences and if there is a downturn in the rental market you could find your own financial security is jeopardised.' Nationwide decided soon after the pension reforms were announced in 2014 that it would consider applicants aged up to 70 for a 35-year loan. The firm said it had recognised that buy-to-let was becoming a more popular source of retirement income as reports suggest half a million savers could plough pension pots into buy-to-let properties after the reforms take effect today. Experts have also warned of the difficulty of taking on a landlords' responsibilities. Financial strategist Penny O'Nions said: 'A lot of people will buy houses with their pension funds with no idea of the repercussions. 'There may be excellent advantages but the downsides are that many of them will not appreciate that the management of a property can be harsh. When you are aged 104, do you really want to be managing a property? 'Difficult tenants feigning problems with the property, periods when the property is empty, council tenants not paying ‚ there is a long list. People should not go into it without good advice.' If a person with a mortgage that lasts until they are 105 dies before paying off the loan, the usual rules apply: their estate, or whoever inherits the property, would either take on the debt or the house would be sold to pay off the mortgage. However, it is cheaper for young people to obtain life cover to pay off the mortgage if they die early.",128,247,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","Pension reforms are giving people over 55 access to billions of pounds to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they please.

Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, used company credit cards to pay for her £10,000 wedding, as well as a £5,000 honeymoon in the Seychelles. She was arrested at Heathrow when she returned from the honeymoon - but now she has been spared jail even though a court heard that she had been convicted of fraud twice previously. Just married: But Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, pictured during her wedding to David Osborne, stole £17,000 to pay for the ceremony and her luxury honeymoon . Fraud: Saunders, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted cheating her company out of thousands of pounds . Saunders, also known as Gabriella Osborne since getting married at Belair House in Dulwich last September, stole £35,000 from her previous employer PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where she worked as a tax accountant. After serving a jail sentence, she started a £40,000-a-year job as a personal assistant at Insight Investments in June last year. But she proceeded to embezzle a total of £17,000 using her colleagues' credit cards - including £600 for flowers, £270 on a new watch, £210 on a new outfit and £400 for a mobile phone. The Old Bailey heard Saunders came to the UK from Nigeria and graduated from Southampton University with a law degree in 2004, before starting work at PwC. While working at the multinational firm, Saunders forged taxi receipts to destinations across the country at up to £250 a time, then signed them off by faking a colleague's signature. Couple: Saunders was convicted of fraud twice before her latest offence . Free: Saunders, pictured with her husband in an engagement photo, was spared jail . Celebration: But Saunders was arrested at Heathrow when the couple returned from their honeymoon . In 2007 she was jailed for six months for fraud, and in 2011 she was again convicted of fraud but spared jail after a court heard she had stolen money from neighbour using credit cards. The day after Saunders started working at Insight Investments in June, she charged £5,272 to a colleague's credit card in order to pay travel agent Trailfinders for her luxury honeymoon with husband David Osborne. Mugshot: Saunders pictured after she was jailed for a £35,000 fraud in 2007 . In September she used another colleague's card to pay £10,254 to Belair House, £268.20 to the jeweller Andrew Charles, £597 to PESH flowers, £208.44 to fashion store ASOS and £390 to EE T-mobile. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said: 'She paid for a prestige wedding venue, she paid for the flowers, she paid for her honeymoon outfit and clothing. 'She paid for phone calls to make these arrangements and she paid for the gift of a watch. She paid for the honeymoon which was a first-class trip to Dubai and then on to the Seychelles. 'They were arrested at Heathrow when they returned to the UK and she made no comment in interview, but it was clear from the evidence that she was solely responsible for these frauds.' Saunders, from Camberwell in south London, admitted seven counts of fraud totalling £16,990, and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Judge Stephen Gullick decided against jailing her after he was told that she had repaid the money and was retraining as a teacher. He said: 'You have a singularly unimpressive record and you have already served a prison sentence some time ago. Pricey: Saunders spent £10,000 of her firm's money to book Belair House for her wedding reception . Honeymoon: She also stole £5,000 to pay for a luxury post-wedding break in the Seychelles .

120,3ZSY5X72NZDENV9WJX9KQHF7SMMROZ,00eb8ba695cba4099488bae9330a109730ad4d39,"Taxpayers are having to find £11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity's report complains: 'The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.' Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons' tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury's paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an 'invention' Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an 'invention'. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. 'For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,' he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: 'The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.' He called on the next government to show leadership 'by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning'. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: 'The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. 'The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn't even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. 'At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn't playing its part to help the country recover.' All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it 'should consider doing so'. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was 'madness' that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: 'Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.' Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: 'If employees weren't getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?' Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits 'should be considered in the round'. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart's low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (£4.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury's said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed £1.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about £8.40 an hour and the industry had paid £19.5bn in 'core business taxes' last year.

A federal jury in Salt Lake City on Thursday awarded more than $270,000 to Marcia Eisenhour after finding that former Justice Court Judge Craig Storey violated her right to equal protection. The jury found Storey liable for some $240,000 of the damages and the county liable for the rest. Storey wrote in 2007, 'I'd love to harvest your sweet grapes,' and called Eisenhour the 'most gorgeous thing alive.'

Utah's Standard Examiner reported that the 'semi-erotic love poem' was 11 pages long. Storey testified that he never intended for her to find or read the poem. Crucial to the case was a meeting Ms Eisenhour had with the Court Judge in July 2008 after she had seen the love note. Storey was said to have asked whether she was in a relationship and where she was going on holiday. For Ms Eisenhour this proved the 'last straw' as far as his possessiveness of her was concerned. Storey claimed his worries related to Ms Eisenhour's weight-loss, recent job performance and absences. He said he was going to have to change her work hours because of complaints from other court staff. Eisenhour said her absences were her attempts to avoid the judge.

The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‚ëdistance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800∞C (1,472∞F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company.

Hydrogen is pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings ‚ known as aromatic hydrocarbons ‚ which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane ‚ for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the ""green economy"" in place.'",100,55,"earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","energy, power, heat, plant, fuel, waste, plants, produce, solar, produced,","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","power plant, use fuel to produce heat, solar energy, fossil fuels produce waste","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","This topic is about power plants, using fuel to produce heat, fossil fuels that produce waste, and solar energy.",Audi has created a new fuel geared towards sustaining resources.

Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period. The couple, from Ward End, Birmingham, claimed £66,268 housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Sikander Rafiq, 34, and Samara Jabreen, 32, lied to Birmingham City Council about their relationship in a scam spanning an eight year period. The couple, from Ward End, pocketed £66,268 housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support . Birmingham Crown Court heard Jabreen first lodged a genuine claim for income support in 2002. But three years later, when Rafiq bought them a house, Jabreen claimed to be a private tenant and asked that her benefit payments be made to her landlord, Rafiq. Blondelle Thompson, prosecuting, said Jabreen also signed declarations saying neither she nor her children were related to Rafiq. She even claimed single occupancy discount on her council tax payments, the court was told. Jabreen pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify a change of circumstances and a charge of making a false representation. Rafiq admitted a charge of furnishing false information regarding the tenancy agreement provided to the city council. But after hearing of her ill-health and that she was the sole carer for their children, Jabreen was spared prison. She was sentenced to 22 weeks, suspended for 18 months, placed under supervision for 18 months and ordered to attend the Anawim probation project for 30 days. Rafiq, it was heard, acted out of desperation to pay their mortgage rather than through greed. He was handed an 18-month sentence, suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work. Birmingham Crown Court heard Jabreen first lodged a genuine claim for income support in 2002. But three years later, when Rafiq bought them a house, Jabreen claimed to be a private tenant and asked that her benefit payments be made to her landlord, Rafiq .

In October 2011 a report was made to the city council's fraud investigation team, prompting an investigation. Ms Thompson added: 'The house was put under surveillance and his car was seen daily and was used by Jabreen.' Life insurance documents and a Virgin Media account were both registered to Rafiq at the couple's address. Judge Roderick Henderson said Rafiq was a 'dishonest' man who had once posed as his brother to avoid getting a criminal record. He said: 'As far as you are concerned I get a very clear picture of a person who is dishonest and bends things to whatever benefits you at a particular time. 'You both pleaded guilty but when you came back to be sentenced you wanted to vacate your plea because you said you were not guilty at all.

She promised to pick up the boy in the morning, but she never returned and eventually stopped answering her brother's messages. It wasn't until the next day that Truong realized he was harboring an abducted child when he read an Amber Alert on online. 'I'm eating my breakfast, I'm checking my Facebook, all of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child,' Truong recounted to KOMO.

Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years, the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new, even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area. ""They slaughtered them in the streets,"" one Yarmouk resident, who asked not to be named, told CNN. ""They (caught) three people and killed them in the street, in front of people. The Islamic State is now in control of almost all the camp."" An estimated 18,000 refugees are now trapped inside Yarmouk, stuck between ISIS and Syrian regime forces in ""the deepest circle of hell,"" in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Yarmouk, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, was formed in 1957 to accommodate people fleeing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp. The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp in an effort to drive out armed groups. Activists and residents in Yarmouk tell CNN that as many as 5,000 people have tried to flee their homes since ISIS stormed the camp, but have no place to go. Hundreds have been injured, but the camp's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS, then targeted last week by regime shelling. As the fighting raged in Yarmouk, the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived. ""We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities,"" Wesam Sabaneh told CNN. ""The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday, so there's really nothing functioning."" Opinion: Save the 'miracle babies' Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task. Majed Alomari, the Jafra Foundation's water coordinator, was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups. The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria (PLHR), who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012, said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help. ""According to my contacts inside, people are back to consuming water with spices -- a common meal used in 2014"" during the Syrian regime's siege of the camp, the PLHR's Salim Salamah told CNN. Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government's stranglehold on the camp last year, and delivered aid to tens of thousands. But now, as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides, residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge, or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death. ""Now I am scared of two things -- I am scared of (ISIS) and the regime,"" the Yarmouk resident told CNN. ""The regime now is about to destroy the Yarmouk camp,"" he said.

Richard Ilczyszyn, a leading financial broker, could be heard 'groaning' and 'crying' by staff on the Orange County-bound plane as it prepared to land. But rather than seeking medical help, the attendants allegedly left the father-of-three in the cubicle and, on landing, letting off all other passengers before calling paramedics. Distraught, Ilczyszyn's wife Kelly, who is a Southwest flight attendant, is filing a wrongful death suit against the airline for failing to act. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Distraught: Kelly Ilczyszyn claims her husband Richard (pictured together with their daughter Sydney) could have survived his heart attack on a Southwest flight if attendants sought medical attention rather than police . Tragic: The leading financial broker was 46 when he lost consciousness on the Orange County-bound flight . Defending their actions, a Southwest spokesman said staff are trained to treat such behavior - screaming and crying in the bathroom - as a security risk. A sheriff's report stated that Ilczyszyn's foot was wedged in the door as he 'groaned' and 'cried' at the end of the flight heading home to Orange County, California, after a business trip. Staff described him to colleagues as 'an unruly passenger,' records reveal. Kelly told CBS News: 'He should have been helped on the aircraft. If they just would have gotten help. 'One flight attendant said she opened the door and she saw the top of my husband's head and his head was down and he was just whimpering, and [she] left him there. 'The paramedics should have met the aircraft. Absolutely. Absolutely. And he would be here today.'

As a flight attendant for the same airline, Kelly explained, the sequence of events baffled her. 'I know if a passenger is in distress... we need to help them,' she said. 'We need to figure out, is he okay, does he need medical attention, what's going on. And so I was very confused why they didn't help my husband.' Ilczyszyn's passing was mourned by the financial community. The founder of independent brokerage firm iiTrader, he spent 10 years as a floor trader in Chicago, and often appeared as a commentator on television.

In 2007, Drogba overturned the one-goal advantage Arsenal had in the 2007 League Cup final through Theo Walcott with another brace, again in Wales. And Drogba's third double against Arsenal was in similar circumstances on March 23, 2008. Bacary Sagna gave The Gunners the lead before Drogba struck twice in nine minutes at Stamford Bridge. The 2009 FA Cup semi-final allowed Drogba to break Arsenal's hearts again with silverware in sight, this time at Wembley. Like the 2007 League Cup final, Walcott put Arsenal ahead but Florent Malouda equalised before Drogba won the cup tie with a goal in the 84th minute.

'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn't say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'naØve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's assertions, pointing out that the statement released by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn't allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It's probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you're going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can't blame the Ayatollah, because I don't think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It's increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can't say I'm surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms ‚ that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran's history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an 'anytime-anywhere' inspections regime.'",162,175,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","Secretary of State John Kerry ""is out of his mind"" was expected to claim that the Iranians agreed to the gradual lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and got away with it, said the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable.

The all-gender restroom has opened in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The facility is the first of its kind at the White House and according to spokesman Jeff Tiller it's something that fits in with the administration's stance on LGBT issues. An all-gender restroom has opened in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House (pictured is a sign marking the entrance to a restroom at the University of Vermont) The facility is the first of its kind at the White House and according to spokesman Jeff Tiller it's something that fits in with the administration's stance on LGBT issues . According to The Advocate, he said: 'The White House allows staff and guests to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, which is in keeping with the administration's existing legal guidance on this issue and consistent with what is required by the executive order that took effect today for federal contractors.' His comment came after the restroom had been alluded to by senior adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett in an op-ed for the publication about protecting LGBT workers. She said: 'We have closely examined our internal policies on everything from benefits, to restroom access, to how we invite people to events, to ensure that everyone who enters this building feels safe and fully respected.' On Wednesday President Obama's Executive Order on LGBT Workplace Discrimination went into effect. It protects the rights of the LGBT community while in the employment of federal contractors and subcontractors. The all-gender restroom opened as Obama's executive order on LGBT workplace discrimination came into effect . Announcing the policy last year, Obama said: 'Our government will become just a little bit fairer. 'I will sign an executive order that does two things. First, the federal government already prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Once I sign this order, the same will be explicitly true for gender identity. 'And second, we're going to prohibit all companies that receive a contract from the federal government from discriminating against their LGBT employees. America's federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people.' On Thursday Obama called for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation or gender identity of gay, lesbian and transgender youth. The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn.

The Vatican says Pope Francis may add another leg to his trip to the United States this September, visiting Cuba just months after he helped negotiate a diplomatic thaw between the two nations. The possibility, which would add a dimension of international intrigue to an already highly anticipated trip, was first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. In response to reporters' questions, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in a statement, ""The Holy Father has taken into consideration the idea of making a stop in Cuba"" on his way to or from the United States this September. ""However, contacts with the Cuban authorities are still in too early a phase for it to be possible to regard this as a firm decision or an operative plan,"" Lombardi continued. Francis, the first pontiff to hail from Latin America, played a key role in the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The Pope made personal pleas to Obama and Cuban leaders in private letters, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries. ""I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,"" Obama said in December as he announced the U.S. policy shift. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs. He repeatedly urged Western leaders not to bomb Syria, hosted a prayer service between Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the Vatican and waded into diplomatic controversy on Sunday by referring to the killing of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago as a ""genocide,"" a move that deeply upset Turkish leaders, who recalled their Vatican ambassador. The Pope is expected to continue his international activism this July with a trip to South America, where he will visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. Just a few months later, in late September, Francis will visit Washington, where he will address Congress; New York, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly; and Philadelphia, where he will celebrate a public Mass that's expected to draw more than 1 million people. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Friday, Archbishop Charles Chaput, the Pope's host in Philadelphia, said he'd hadn't heard about the potential for a papal visit to Cuba until he turned on the morning news. Two previous Popes have visited the Caribbean nation: St. John Paul II in 1998 and former Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.",162,97,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","visit, pope, peace, catholic, roman, ceremony, meeting, anniversary, commonwealth, archbishop,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","visiting the pope, roman catholic church, archbishop, ceremonial meeting for peace","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about visiting the pope, roman catholic church, archbishop, and ceremonial meeting for peace.","Pope Francis will be visiting the United States this September, including Washington, New York, and Philadelphia.

A married mother of two battling cancer whose removal from an Alaska Airlines flight caused outrage online said on Wednesday that the carrier refunded her family's airfare, which will be donated to research. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been viewed thousands of times. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight . Caught on camera: Sedway posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane . In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. 'Her family's tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family's overnight accommodations in Lihue,' Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. 'While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.' Alaska Airlines apologized for the incident but said the employee had Sedway's health in mind. 'We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced Monday,' Knigge said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Sedway posted on her Facebook page on Wednesday that the 'silver lining' of her family's experience would be that the value of their airline tickets would go to study the blood cancer multiple myeloma, for which she is being treated. She wrote 'Our family talked during the flight home from Hawaii, and decided how we wanted this situation to conclude. As with most unpleasant times, there are silver linings, if we're determined to find them. Here, we plan to donate the airfare, to be refunded by Alaska Airlines, to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation ‚ MMRF.

Dutch national Sjaak Rijke (seen, above, in a video in August 2012 while being held hostage by an Al Qaeda splinter group) has been rescued by French special forces nearly four years after being captured in Mali . Mr Hollande's statement did not identify who was holding Rijke, but the Dutchman appeared in a video posted in November by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Some 3,000 French forces are taking part in the mission to stabilize Mali, which was overrun by Al Qaeda -linked extremists until French troops came to the aid of Malian soldiers in January 2013. Rijke was abducted by extremists in November 2011 from a hostel in Timbuktu along with two other people . A German died in the attack. Officials in France and the Netherlands did not say whether there was any news of the other two. However, it is thought they are still being held.

The new data, released by the United Nations, shows how the number of international migrants has increased by nearly 80 million over the last 25 years. In 1995, there were more than 154 million migrants who left their home country and moved to another for various reasons. In comparison, that number had risen to 231 million globally by 2013, according to the international migrant stock trends data. The graphic, featured in The Telegraph, comes at a time when immigration is being heavily discussed by political parties, who each have varying policies on the issue in their manifestos, in the lead-up to May's election. It reveals that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are among the nations which have a high number of immigrants, with more than 7.8 million recorded. Other European countries also have similar numbers, with Germany having nine million, France recording 7.5million and Spain reporting more than six million. Meanwhile, the U.S. has more than 45 million immigrants - the most of all nations - and Russia has more than 11 million. Saudi Arabia has nine million. Countries which had the fewest number of immigrants include Morocco with 50,000, Mongolia with just 17,000 and Greenland with only 5,000. Others with low figures include Tunisia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba and Guyana. The top worldwide destinations for international migrants were the U.S., Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, UK and France, according to the data. It also revealed the areas in the UK where immigrants live, with London, Leicester, the Birmingham area and Bradford among those with the highest percentage. The figures come after it emerged Prime Minister David Cameron had failed in his pledge to slash net migration to the tens of thousands before the general election. Official figures, released in February by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show there was a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the year to September last year, equal to the population of a city roughly the size of Nottingham and up from 210,000 in the previous 12 months. The increase in net migration was driven by a 'statistically significant' rise in immigrants arriving in the UK - up to 624,000 in the year to September 2014 from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. Around 327,000 people emigrated from the UK in the same period. Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May had promised to slash net migration to below 100,000 by the end of the current parliamentary term. The figures also revealed there were significant increases in immigration of non-EU citizens - up 49,000 to 292,000 - and European Union citizens - up 43,000 to 251,000. Experts flagged another statistically significant increase in Romanian and Bulgarian citizens arriving in the UK - up to 37,000 from 24,000 in the previous 12 months. Of these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on the year ending September 2013, the ONS added. Around 271,000 people came to the UK for work, up 54,000 on a year earlier, while immigration for study rose from 175,000 to 192,000. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said at the time: 'UK job growth is likely to be a key factor behind the recent increases. 'If the UK's economic performance compared to the rest of the EU had been poor, then we might well have seen net migration fall, but that has not happened. 'Rising work-related migration from outside the EU has also contributed.'

The Gunners have won seven straight games since defeat against fierce rivals Tottenham at White Hart Lane on February 7, a run of form which has moved them to second place in the table. Now just seven points behind leaders Chelsea, Arsenal have a chance to surpass Manchester City's equally impressive run of seven victories in a row this season when they take on relegation-threatened Burnley in Saturday's late kick-off.

City earned maximum points from seven games prior to throwing away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at home to the Clarets on December 28. With Burnley battling for survival, the Gunners will be wary of a similarly damaging result when they take on Sean Dyche's spirited team in front of the Sky Sports cameras. But if they do manage to take three points from Turf Moor, Arsenal will still be on target to match their best ever winning streak in the Premier League era by the time the season is over. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive wins, having come out on top in 14 successive games between February and August in 2002. That run, which was also overseen by Wenger, helped Arsenal beat Liverpool and Manchester United to the 2001-02 title before a draw at West Ham in the second game of the following season ended the streak. United sit second on the list, having put together a 12-game winning run under Sir Alex Ferguson between March and August 2000. Their storming end to the 1999-00 campaign ensured the Red Devils comfortably won their sixth Premier League title, with second-placed Arsenal finishing a massive 18 points behind them. Chelsea's longest winning streak stands at 11 games between April and September in 2009 as interim boss Guus Hiddink and his successor, Carlo Ancelotti, helped the Blues hit top form. Liverpool put together their best run of form last season as they stormed towards their first Premier League title before faltering in two of their final three games. Aided by the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, Brendan Rodgers' side also managed 11 straight wins between February and April before losing 2-0 at home to Chelsea. Manchester City were just one victory away from equalling their best run of eight straight wins earlier this season but they couldn't quite manage to repeat the feat they managed between December 2013 and January 2014. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive victories - winning 14 games to clinch the title in 2002 . Manchester United's winning streak of 12 games helped Sir Alex Ferguson's men to the title in 1999-00 . Chelsea striker Demba Ba slides the ball home at Anfield to end Liverpool's 11-game winning run last season . Everton also put together their best ever run in the Premier League last season, earning seven wins on the bounce between March and April last year as they tried and failed to break into the top four.

Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice . Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London . It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'",196,48,"school, schools, teacher, high, education, parents, teachers, hughes, children, students","food, restaurant, eat, eating, babies, meal, drinks, fruit, breakfast, chicken,","high school teacher, high school students, education in schools, parents meet teachers, children going to school","eating food at a restaurant, a healthy meal, ordering something to drink, serving breakfast, fruits are a healthy food, eating chicken","This topic is about high school students and children going to school, education in schools, and parents meeting teachers.","This topic is about eating food at a restaurant, ordering something to drink and serving breakfast, as well as eating chicken, and fruits which are a healthy food.",A primary school headteacher pushed to have children to drink only water in school.

Public opinion on same-sex marriage has turned upside down since the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts first legalized the practice in 2003. Overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support, especially among young people of all political persuasions. Even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality. Of course, the Constitution has not changed since 2003, a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same-sex marriage as Justice Antonin Scalia. To originalists like Scalia -- those who believe the Constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage is anathema. To them, the Constitution means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and James Madison (or the authors of the 14th Amendment, just after the Civil War) never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry. But the Supreme Court has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers. And public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race, even though the authors of the 14th Amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who wrote the opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, recognized that the world had changed, especially in light of the Cold War. Warren knew that segregated schools damaged the United States' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world, and he steered the court accordingly. Warren's motives had nothing to do with the framers' intentions, and little to do with the words of the Constitution itself, but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the Supreme Court. There are risks, of course, when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the Constitution. Like everyone else, the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women, but she has expressed reservations about the court's decision in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion. She has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway, and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights. Her position is debatable on several scores. Abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the '70s, and opponents were already well mobilized. But Ginsburg's misgivings about Roe have served as an important backdrop to the Supreme Court's consideration of same-sex marriage. Still, when it comes to Supreme Court decisions, it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public. In any case, as we head into the argument, it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds. After the court decided United States v. Windsor in 2013, which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the Defense of Marriage Act, more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same-sex marriage. These judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country. Supporters of the existing laws went to the Supreme Court and asked for stays of the lower court rulings, because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place. But in each case, the Supreme Court denied the stays and allowed same-sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia. In a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues. ""This acquiescence [in allowing marriages to proceed] may well be seen as a signal of the court's intended resolution of that question,"" Thomas wrote. ""This is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities."" But Thomas only drew Scalia to join his dissent, suggesting that even fellow conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Samuel Alito saw the writing on the wall. In any case, at oral argument, we'll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue. But we already know that their decision, like so many in the court's history, will be based on a great deal more than the text of the Constitution.",46,78,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","court, judge, case, appeal, justice, order, ruling, ruled, magistrates, ordered,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","a court ruling, department of justice, appealed against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, court order, magistrates","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about a court ruling, department of justice, appealing against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, a court order, and magistrates.","The issue of same-sex marriage will come before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

As public opinion has wholly changed on the topic, they will not only have to consider interpretation of the Constitution, but also political pressure due to the fact that popular opinion is in favor of marriage equality. Much like the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling that public schools could no longer segregate by race, some urge for Supreme Court justices to recognize that the world has changed."

Ex-Bolton Wanderers forward Delroy Facey, 34, is also alleged to have told a contact that some Football Conference teams would 'do' a game in return for payment. Facey, whose former clubs include Hull City and West Bromwich Albion, is accused of conspiring with non-league player Moses Swaibu and others to commit bribery. Delroy Facey (right) arrives at Birmingham Crown Court for the start of his trial on Monday. He is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches . Facey (right) is alleged to have contacted a non-league player via WhatsApp to fix matches . Facey (right) celebrates after scoring for Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League in 2003 . On the second day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, prosecutor Nick Mather claimed records of online messages showed Facey had approached footballers about 'throwing' lower league matches. In one text conversation, conducted on messaging service WhatsApp in late 2013, Facey is alleged to have tried to corrupt Greater Manchester-based Hyde FC player Scott Spencer by offering him £2,000. The court heard that Facey, of Huddersfield, made contact with Mr Spencer shortly after discussing Hyde's poor run of form with a convicted match-fixer. Mr Spencer, who the court heard was not involved in any form of match-fixing, is alleged to have been messaged by Facey, who told him: 'You lot (Hyde) get rinsed out, week in, week out. Defendant Moses Swaibu (right) on the ball during an FA Cup match between Lincoln and Bolton in 2010 . 'You lot should make some money out of this lad, easy money. 'Check this out. Four goals in a game - two in either half - and you guys can get 2k each, win lose or draw. 'You guys can't win for s*** so you may as well make some peas.' During the WhatsApp conversation, which was read to jurors by Mr Mather, Facey is alleged to have added that a friend who was betting would provide the cash. Addressing the jury on the second day of his opening speech, Mr Mather claimed Facey was attempting to bribe Mr Spencer and team-mates that he trusted into fixing a match. Facey (top) in action for West Brom during a match against Norwich City in March 2004 . Mr Mather further alleged that Facey told a convicted match-fixer in another message: 'I have got (Football) Conference teams that will 'do' a game but how much?' Transcripts of messages which passed between Facey and 43-year-old Krishna Ganeshan, who was found guilty of conspiracy at an earlier trial, were also shown to the jury. In an exchange on October 28 2013, the court heard, Ganeshan used Skype to contact Facey, telling him: 'Get ready, things are about to come to life. Keep your boys on stand-by. 'If they deliver first time, me and only you are in big business for the future.' Huddersfield's Facey (left) vies with Brentford's Michael Dobson during an old Second Division match in 2002 . The Crown claims the Skype discussion - and a message sent by Facey claiming six players in the Football Conference were 'amenable' to match-fixing - could not have been part of an attempt to rip off a gambling syndicate. Mr Mather told the jury: 'It may be suggested to you that what Delroy Facey was actually up to was trying to scam people who were betting on football matches. 'The prosecution say that is not the case.' Facey and Swaibu, 25, of Bermondsey, south London, deny conspiring together and with others to commit bribery between November 1 and 27 2013.

In an apparent effort to push past the scandal, the British-born fashion designer, who turned 39 on Tuesday, shared an Instagram image of a large bouquet of flowers he had bought for her. 'Thank you for my beautiful flowers!!! #wonderfulhusband #birthday,' she wrote alongside the photo. Scroll down for video . Moving on: Georgina Chapman, who is married to Harvey Weinstein, shared this image to her Instagram page on Tuesday, with the caption: 'Thank you for my beautiful flowers!!! #wonderfulhusband #birthday . Scandal: Chapman, pictured with her husband in February, was reportedly 'furious' after he was accused of groping an Italian model in his Manhattan office last month and wants to put it behind her . The birthday gift comes four days after her Hollywood producer husband learned he will not face criminal charges after Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police he had groped her. Battilana had claimed that the 63-year-old father-of-five touched her breasts and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca Film Center office in Manhattan on March 27. The Manhattan District Attorney's office investigated the model's claims but announced last Friday that it has decided not to prosecute Weinstein. Weinstein, who had always maintained his innocence, could have faced misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations proved true. Battilana reoprtedly refused to cooperate with authorities for four days after the complaint, which led to speculation she made the allegation in a bid to try and land a part in one of Weinstein's films. Once that 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to cooperate and pursue the criminal case, according to sources. Claims: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Weinstein groped her during a meeting last month . Denial: Weinstein, pictured last week, had insisted he had never touched the model and on Friday, yhe Manhattan District Attorney's office said it would not be prosecuting him .

The Premier League side recorded a 2-0 victory on the night but went out on away goals after the tie finished level at 3-3 on aggregate. Monaco, which won 3-1 in the first leg, was overwhelmed for much of the contest and was fortunate to escape without being dumped out of the competition. Olivier Giroud's first half strike and Aaron Ramsey's 79th minute effort ensured a tense finale but the visiting side was unable to find a winner. No team had ever overcome a two-goal first leg deficit away from home in the Champions League and progressed -- but Arsenal's first half display gave it hope. Giroud, who has often been criticized this season for failing to take his chances, lashed in from close range with nine minutes of the first half remaining. Ramsey, a substitute, drove the ball into the net after Theo Walcott's effort had struck the post and Monaco's defenders hesitated. Giroud had a chance late on to cap a dramatic fightback but his effort was saved on the line. ""The best team went through,"" Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker told ITV. ""Monaco deserved it because they played much better in the first leg. We played well today but it was a massive deficit, and it wasn't enough tonight.

But chilly temperatures in the northeast have kept snow on the ground well into April. One family on New York's Long Island were even able to keep a snowman alive until this weekend, when their Frosty finally melted in 70-degree temperatures. But before the snowman withered away, he became somewhat of an internet celebrity, with more than 3,000 people liking the page the family dedicated to their carrot-nosed friend on Facebook. Scroll down for video . Until next year!

Remnants: The Fregoe family took a small ball of ice from the snowman to store in the freezer until next winter, when he will come to life again . Mike Fregoe of Massapequa Park says he and his family built the snowman in January, when it grew to be more than 9-feet tall. Since then, the snowman's height has fluctuated as late winter storms have continued to dump snow even into March. He says he has kept the snowman alive with his teen daughter Rebecca. 'It started out as a small project for fun, and it's morphed into the ongoing snow saga, and it's a great thing that makes everybody smile and happy, and we're having fun with it still,' Mr Fregoe told CBS New York last week. Keeping winter alive: Mike Fregoe went to a local park every day to collect melting snow by the bucket-full to add to his snowman . Last ditch effort: Mr Fregoe pictured adding to the snowman last week, when the weather was so warm he was wearing a tank top . But since the beginning of April, the snowman began shrinking and the family started a Facebook page asking for 'snownations' to keep their beloved Frosty alive. 'I won't take snow from an ice skating rink or any artificial snow,' Mr Fregoe said. 'The only way this guy is going to stay alive is with the snow from this winter.' Mr Fregoe says he's received snow from people visiting the snowman from as far away as Vermont, as well as closer communities like the Hamptons. The Fregoes also did a lot of the work themselves, taking daily trips to the park to shovel melting snow by the bucket load. Ups and downs: Above, pictures of the Fregoe's snowman this winter, when he climbed to 9-feet tall after a late January snow storm .

Peter Tait, the headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School in Dorset, claimed parents have become 'dervishes' about their children's education and should take a back seat to allow them to develop naturally. Writing in Attain, the magazine for the Independent Association of Prep Schools, Mr Tait said the modern trend of interfering stemmed from parents being bombarded with information about how to raise a child. Parents need to keep their distance and use their intuition to trust schools and teachers, a leading head teacher has claimed. Stock image used . Mr Tait warned that while parents naturally wanted the very best for their children, such interference could end up hindering their natural development, The Daily Telegraph reported. He said: 'What has made some parents put their own child at the centre of the universe and to hell with the rest?' Adding that parents must trust those responsible for their children's education, he added: 'To do this requires a certain detachment, a willingness to trust the passage of time, focusing on whether their children are happy, challenged and purposeful and are learning the right values.' Sherborne, which was founded in 1550 by Edward VI in the Dorset village of the same name, has educated prominent churchmen and army generals, as well as famous figures such as codebreaker Alan Turing and Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville and Coldplay singer Chris Martin. The school has enjoyed strong academic performance recently. On A-Level results day it was announced that 40 per cent of all grades were A*s or As, with six boys meeting offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge. The phenomenon of parents placing their children before any others and pushes their children to high levels of achievement through a range of after-school activities has been termed Tiger Parenting. Last year, Gail Larkin, the president of the National Association of Head Teachers, also attacked parents saying that some children were being forced to sit through hours of unnecessary tuition by pushy parents competing with one another. She added that instead of two or three hours spent in more classes after school, children would benefit from joining a swimming club, taking up ballet, or playing in the park instead. Mr Tait is Headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School (pictured) in Dorset, who has been writing in Attain magazine . She also took a swipe at parents, saying part of the drive for extra tuition was down to adults being unwilling to help their children with homework. Meanwhile a survey, by teachers' union NASUWT, revealed a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. It showed families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers - with 30 per cent of those polled confirming they had been the subject of parents' abusive internet posts. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year ‚ increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.' He added: 'The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.'",196,200,"school, schools, teacher, high, education, parents, teachers, hughes, children, students","children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","high school teacher, high school students, education in schools, parents meet teachers, children going to school","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","This topic is about high school students and children going to school, education in schools, and parents meeting teachers.","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.",The educators want parents to stop interfering in the education of their children. Education staff are seeing an increase in online abuse which is hindering their ability to perform their daily tasks. Instead of extra tutoring children should be exposed to new activities to broaden their horizons.,Parents are becoming increasingly controlling over the lives of their children. Tiger Parenting is forcing many children to take on increased workloads and it is interfering with their development. The over sensitivity of parents to the lives of their children is causing a detrimental effect to the behavior of both parent and child. It has caused a lack of respect to institutions outside the family unit.

Abubaker Deghayes, 46, has left his home in Brighton in an attempt to rescue his son Amer, who travelled to the Middle East in January last year. The 21-year-old has been fighting for the organisation Jabhat al-Nusra, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, who are battling the Islamic State and Syrian forces. Abubaker Deghayes, whose two sons died while fighting in Syria. He has now left his home in Brighton to travel to the Middle East to bring home his remaining son Amer, who is also in Syria . Mr Deghayes eldest son Amer, who is fighting for the Jabhat al-Nusra, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, who are battling the Islamic State and Syrian forces. He has not been in contact with his father . Mr Deghayes two younger sons were killed fighting Syrian government forces in two separate incidents last year. Abdullah, 18, was killed last April after suffering a bullet wound to his stomach and Jaffar, 17, was reported dead six months later after being shot in the head during a battle in Aleppo. And after not hearing from Amer, who is also in Syria, for nearly four weeks, he says he is on his way to the country to rescue his son. Mr Deghayes has insisted he has not 'run away' to join the fight and has informed British authorities of his intentions to rescue his last-remaining son. It is believed he is with his brother Omar Deghayes, with the pair currently in Tripoli, the capital of Libya, after travelling via Italy and Tunisia. Omar was previously held by the US as an enemy combatant at the notorious Guantanamo Bay detention centre between 2002 and 2007, but was released without charge. Speaking from Libya, Mr Deghayes said: 'I am in Tripoli at the moment in Libya. 'It looks and sounds like I have run away from the authorities but I didn't leave until I informed them, through my lawyers, what I was intending to do. 'I will go and try to bring Amer home. I told people that I have been going to Syria long before the government started to change its stance on people going out there.' Mr Deghayes younger sons Abdullah, left, and Jaffar, right, who were both killed in separate incidents while fighting in Syria . Jaffar Deghayes was spotted leaving Gatwick Airport for Syria with three other men from the Portsmouth area . Mr Deghayes found out that his first son, Abdullah, had died in Syria when his eldest son Amer called him and told him . It is not the first time he has pleaded with his sons to come home, and he once travelled to Turkey and met Jaffar and Abdullah to try and stop them from entering Syria, but failed. His dramatic rescue could also be in vain as in November Amer said he wouldn't come back to the UK until 'all Muslim lands are liberated' and that jihad was 'not for tasters.' Mr Deghayes also insisted that he could have easily joined the fighting if he wanted to, but chose not to because he disagrees with war. He added: 'If I wanted to join the fighting, I could have done so easily. But out of personal belief and nature, and not the government, I haven't. I don't like wars and bloodshed. 'I am fine and all is well. I shall be back in Brighton soon.' Mr Deghayes is a trustee of a local mosque in East Sussex, and is a controversial figure, who once said a suicide attack on Tony Blair could be morally justified. He was secretly recorded at a mosque in 2006 branding the then prime minister and US president George W Bush 'legitimate targets'. He previously insisted that his three sons were not 'terrorists' but had travelled to Syria to defend 'those who are weak'. Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . The Deghayes brothers while they were young. Their family insist they went to Syria to help the weak . He said his sons had been 'stubborn' about travelling to Syria after seeing videos of the atrocities online. In a film released last year, Amer said he had no intention of returning to Britain, adding: 'My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.' He added: 'I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.' Since Amer travelled to Syria, he has been in regular contact with his father and mother Einas Abulsayen via Skype. It was during two such phonecalls that be broke the news that his brothers had been killed. The first call came in April. Speaking about Abdullah's death at the time, Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. Mr Deghayes is believed to have travelled to Libya with his brother Omar, pictured, who was previously held by the US as an enemy combatant at the notorious Guantanamo Bay detention centre . 'He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Meanwhile when Jaffar died six months later, he added: 'Amer sent me a message via the internet. All I know is that (Jaffar) was fighting against Assad and was killed in battle. 'I don't know much else. I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.' The Brighton father's attempt to rescue his son comes as reports suggested a 17-year-old girl from Brighton was stopped at Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, on suspicion of attempting to join jihadis in Syria. The teenager is described as a close friend of the Deghayes family. Sussex Police have urged members of the public with concerns or information about anyone planning to travel to Syria to contact them. The force said in a statement: 'The Government advice continues to be that no one should travel to these war zones and that the most effective way to help the affected population is through humanitarian support.'",115,64,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.",Mr. Deghayes has lost his two younger sons in previous alqaeda battles in Syria.

Still, he was a big deal. That's the assessment of multiple sources on a man who may not have been well-known in the West, but nonetheless had a special role in the terrorist group. Farouq -- an American -- died in a U.S. counterterrorism airstrike in January, according to the White House. Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups. The group's spokesman, Usama Mahmoud, on Twitter compared the Pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to Nidal Hasan, SITE reported. Hasan is the U.S. Army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas. Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said that Farouq and another top figure, Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in a January 15 drone strike in Pakistan's Shawal Valley.

A federal jury found Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday over the terror attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260. He kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down at the defence table in the Boston courtroom as the guilty verdicts were read. A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defence team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on Wednesday. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . Boston Police patrol the outside the John J Moakley Federal Courthouse after the jury verdict . The jury will now decide whether the 21-year-old former student should be sentenced to death or receive life in prison. Tsarnaev's conviction was widely expected, given his lawyer's startling admission during opening statements that he took part in the bombing. But the lawyer also argued that Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, masterminded the attack and enlisted his then-19-year-old brother to help. On April 19, 2013, Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat and had written notes inside suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries . Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as full partners in a plan to retaliate against the US for its wars in Muslim countries. The court will likely meet early next week to resume the penalty phase. Families of the victims were also present to hear the verdict but there was no celebration after each 'guilty' was read and jury members were similarly somber. COUNT 1: GUILTY .

Offering a half-grin to the camera with his signature pony-tail tucked away from view, Holpin tells prospective conquests: 'I love my kids,' in a brief biography on his Plenty of Fish account. Listed among his hobbies is watching TV and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets, as revealed earlier this week. But while Holpin paints himself as a doting father, one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, two of his sons have revealed they wish they'd never even come into contact with him. Fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister, care worker Mike Holpin Junior, 22, said dramatically: 'I wish I'd never met my dad. I'd rather be related to Hitler than to him.' Younger brother Luke, 21, said so bad was his father's womanising, his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes. 'As soon as the money dried up he moved on. It devastated her. 'She caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife.' 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiance Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . The brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes. Earlier this week it was revealed Holpin had cost the taxpayer an estimated £4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children. At least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000. Child tax credits would have been worth an average of £2,000 per year, per child if the parents were not working. That's £800,000. HIS BENEFITS: Mr Holpin claims he has received up to £27,000 a year in benefits, totalling £675,000. TOTAL BILL: £4,375,000 . Despite not being able to recognise all of his children in the street, Holpin is in no rush to stop reproducing. Leaping to his defence, fiancee Diane Morris, 46, told The Sun: 'He's a good guy. He's been unfaithful but that's all in the past'. One of his youngest children, a three-year-old girl, was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby. He said: 'I helped them by having sex with her. For all my sins I have done one or two things right'. One of his children, Hayley, 25, who is also unemployed, said: 'He was a p***head but he's done well. I'm proud,' she told The Sun. But Mr Holpin's brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker's 'shocking' behaviour had brought 'shame' on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: 'I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago ‚ he didn't have a phone so we couldn't keep in touch. 'It wouldn't surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. 'I'm not ashamed of Michael, but I'm upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. 'He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.' His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. Addicted: Holpin plays on his three £450 PS4 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits . Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children's mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: 'I'll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I'm doing what God wants. 'I'm as fertile as sin. I don't believe in contraception and I love sex'. He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin's claim to 40 children ‚ aged between three and 37 ‚ was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: 'Feeling Asshamed' (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. 'Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they've suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I'm an alcoholic. I'm still an alcoholic ‚ I just don't practise it.' TaxPayers' Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: 'It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.' But former friends say Mr Holpin's boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had 'padded' his numbers by including his ex-partner's stepchildren. He added: 'He's no angel after a drink but he isn't the big ladies' man that he likes to think he is. 'He's definitely had a football team's worth of little 'uns ‚ maybe 16 ‚ just because he's not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.' Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin's daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: 'You can all hate but it doesn't matter, there's plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. 'I feel like I can't even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn't ask my dad to do what he's done with his life.' Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Day out: Mike and Diane with some of the children at their local bowling alley . New life: The father-of-40 lives with his fiance Diane Morris, ten years his junior, and they live in a two-bed council house in South Wales .",115,200,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.",Mike was fond of many women and had no plans to settle down anytime soon.

The Stoke manager has kept the club's chequebook largely in his pocket since taking over in May 2013 but said he would splash out when the right player became available. Signing Begovic to a new contract is a priority given the Bosnia goalkeeper will be entering the final year of his current deal. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes is confident he will have money to spend in the summer transfer window . Hughes wants goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to agree a new contract at the Britannia Stadium . But Hughes will add expensive acquisitions if needed, having missed out on £10million Xherdan Shaqiri in the January window. Hughes said: 'We haven't spent a great deal since I've been here. A net spend of £6million I think over four transfer windows. 'But I've never been given the impression that if the right player was available and we wanted to really push the boat out there wouldn't be funds available. 'We've chased any number of players and some targets we've got very, very close to where we would have been in a position to make a decision whether or not we spent a significant amount. Stoke sit 10th in the Premier League and still have an outside chance of earning a European berth . Begovic is out of contract at the end of next season and could be targeted by clubs this summer . 'We've never actually got to the point where we've needed to just because the target fell by the wayside. I've never been in any doubt that if the right target is available then the finances will be made available to me.' A host of clubs may decide to make a move for Begovic, 27, who is set to open talks over extending his Stoke stay once the season is over. Hughes said: 'I'm sure they will be looking at him. But we've got a lot of things we can offer to Asmir. 'He knows we're a good club that will continue hopefully to progress. He wants to be part of a successful football club, I know that. He's an ambitious guy.

158,3AAPLD8UCEJHBT01J9JP6NJO4CTHTK,cb38c8917af2e790f064ca9738842e7629a7d198,"The White House, the State Department and Democrats on Capitol Hill are side-stepping questions about Hillary Clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates. While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I'm saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth ‚¶ we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We're probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you're going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, ""Maybe we need another person in this race."" And that is really problematic.' 'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said.

Now Luke Harris and Daryl Lee are celebrating the birth of their second baby. And the gay couple are due to become fathers for the third time in just a few weeks after controversially enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers. Scroll down for video . Luke Harris and Daryl Lee, from Surrey, had their first child three months ago and are now preparing to welcome their third baby into the world after enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers.

Showing off baby number two for the first time, the civil partners told how their rapidly expanding brood has left them exhausted but elated. The latest addition is daughter Willow-Star Shirley Harris-Lee. She was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis's home on February 25 ‚ after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the gay dads' were woken by a text message saying: 'Your little girl is here!' First child Phoenix Blue Harris-Lee ‚ a boy ‚ was born naturally on January 14 after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz. His surrogate mother was Bex Harris, Viktoria's best friend. Baby number three ‚ known to be a boy ‚ is being carried by Bex's sister-in-law Becky Harris and is due in July. The birth will mean Mr Harris ‚ who is not related to the two mothers ‚ and Mr Lee will have completed their family of three within seven months. Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer from Surrey, said: 'Going from having an empty home to having two precious babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind, but even after weeks of feeding on demand we feel overjoyed. 'We are relishing every moment of becoming dads. We spent 15 years fearing we'd never be able to have children, so while at times, as every parent knows, you are completely knackered, the sense of elation far outweighs any negatives.' He described becoming fathers as 'life-affirming and life-changing' for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist. 'We now truly understand what unconditional love means ‚ the only downside is that we don't go to the pub any more!' said Mr Harris. 'We now don't look at ourselves as a couple, we are a family unit, and fiercely protective of our little clan.' Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer (pictured left holding Willow-Star), described becoming fathers as 'life-affirming and life-changing' for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist (right with Phoenix Blue).

Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) will soon be joined by another sibling when surrogate Becky Harris gives birth to a boy in July . Phoenix (right) was born using Bex Harris's eggs and Mr Lee's sperm while Willow-Star (left) was created using Viktoria's eggs and Mr Harris's sperm, meaning they are not biologically connected. The couple's third child, yet to be born, was created using Mr Lee's sperm . Willow-Star was delivered by Viktoria's neighbour in Suffolk, who happens to be Bex's mother, Karen Harris, who also runs the internet surrogacy forum where the women and fathers met. Mr Harris and Mr Lee drove there as soon as they could. 'When we arrived at Viktoria's house our beautiful daughter was snuggled up in blankets, looking so tiny and vulnerable and she was absolutely perfect in every way,' Mr Harris said. After a hospital check-up, the couple took Willow home to meet Phoenix, who was born using Bex's eggs and Mr Lee's sperm. As Willow was created using Viktoria's eggs and Mr Harris's sperm, they are not biologically connected. The couple looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogates, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy. After the birth of their third child, the couple will have become a family of three in seven months . Their most recent child is daughter Willow-Star who was born via surrogate Viktoria Ellis (centre holding Willow). Mr Lee (pictured right holding 11-week-old Phoenix) and Mr Harris said they were a little daunted by the prospect of a third child but will take it in their stride . Mr Lee (pictured left with Willow-Star) and Mr Harris (right with Phoenix), who met in 1999 before becoming civil partners in 2012, said: 'While we may not meet some people's idea of a traditional family, all our children will be cherished in a stable, loving environment' Mr Harris said: 'As far as we're concerned Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) are brother and sister and that's how they'll be brought up' The couple's, as yet unborn, son was created using Mr Lee's sperm, meaning he will be Phoenix's half-brother. But Mr Harris said: 'As far as we're concerned Phoenix and Willow-Star are brother and sister and that's how they'll be brought up. 'While we may not meet some people's idea of a traditional family, all our children will be cherished in a stable, loving environment.' The couple met in 1999 and became civil partners in 2012. They looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogate mothers, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy.

Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a naturalized American citizen of Somali descent, had been instructed by a cleric to return to the United States and carry out an act of terrorism, the indictment said. The Justice Department stated that Mohamud was also an Islamic State sympathizer, and that his brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the group in Syria in 2013. Terror suspect: Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, from Columbus, Ohio, has been arrested and charged with supporting terrorism after getting training in Syria . According to court documents, Mohamud left the US a year ago with the intent to go to Syria and train with a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. In April 2014, he purchased a one-way ticket to Greece, but during a layover in Istanbul he failed to board a connecting flight to Athens and instead made his way to Syria. Once he reached his destination, Mohamud stated that he received training in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, explosives and hand-to-hand combat. The 23-year-old Columbus man aloes said that after completing his training, a cleric with the group Jabhat al-Nusrah instructed him to return to the US and commit an act of terror. The 23-year-old returned to the US in June 2014 with a plot to attack a military base or a correctional facility, targeting people in uniform, according to court documents. 'Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States,' the papers cited by ABC News indicate. 'He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style.' On Thursday, Mohamud was indicted on one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and one count of making false statements to the FBI. The first two counts, providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization are each crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, left, speaks with his defense attorney, Sam Shamansky, during a hearing to set bond on state charges of money laundering and providing support for terrorism in February . Making false statements involving international terrorism carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison. Mohamud was arrested on state charges February 21, 2015, and is expected to be transferred into federal custody based on today's indictment. Before Mohamud's brother was killed in battle on or around June 3, 2014, the two had exchanged emails discussing the 23-year-old's plans to travel to Syria and fight with Islamic State. In February, Mohamud asked Abdifatah Aden how he could send him money. Later that month, Mohamud was arrested at his Columbus home for allegedly providing a computer tablet an other material support to terroist organizations aborad. Prosecutor Ron O'Brien at the time asked a judge to set Mohamud's bond at $1million saying he was a flight risk and posed a threat to public safety.

Arsene Wenger's side were hanging by a thread against their lower league opponents, when Paul Peschisolido headed what looked like an equaliser but Seaman somehow managed to hook it away from goal - leaving players and fans speechless. The 51-year-old revealed to the Daily Mirror, that the save was the best of his career and topped his penalty heroics at Euro 96 for England.

There's been no break from the globe's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4∞F (13.6∞C), which is 1.5∞F (0.85∞C) above the average for the 20th century. Last month's average temperature of 56.4∞F (13.6∞C) was the hottest March on record, averaging 1.5∞F (0.85∞C) above the average for the 20th century. This was the highest for March in the 1880‚2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09∞F (0.05∞C). Pictured is how the high temperatures affected different regions of the world . The data, released today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces. It follows earlier announcements from US government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history. Scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, leading to increased temperatures, melting of polar ice and glaciers, and rising seas. 'This was the highest for March in the 1880-2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09∞F (0.05∞C),' said the report. The warmth was spread fairly evenly across the hemispheres. Most land areas were warmer to much warmer than average, as shown by the Temperature Percentiles map on the right, with record warmth in parts of the western United States and Canada, various regions in eastern Africa, parts of Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, part of south central China, and an area of northeastern Australia . NOAA scientist Jessica Blunden blames the heat on El Ni±o and climate change. El Ni±o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific. This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Ni±o, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east. This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Ni±o grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni±o will continue through the summer. For the first three months of the year, the average temperature worldwide was 1.48∞F (0.82∞C) above the 20th-century average. That marked the highest ever recorded for that period, surpassing the previous record in 2002 by 0.09∞F (0.05∞C). Also of concern was the finding that Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for March. 'The average Arctic sea ice extent for March was 430,000 square miles (7.2 percent) below the 1981‚2010 average,' said the report. 'This was the smallest March extent since records began in 1979.' NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said 2015 probably will break 2014's hottest year mark if conditions persist. The first three months of 2015 were nearly a tenth of a degree higher than the old record and four-tenths of a degree warmer than January through March of last year. Much of the most abnormal heat has been in the Pacific Ocean and places near it. Seven western U.S. states set records for their hottest first three months of the year, while New York and Vermont set records for the coldest start of a year. The northeastern United States has been one of the few colder-than-normal spots on the globe with entire continents of Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia coming in solidly warmer than normal. Blunden blames the record heat on a combination of El Ni±o, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and human-caused climate change. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Ni±o will continue through the summer. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Ni±o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Ni±o to increase global temperatures. The maps below represent rainfall per cent of normal (left, using a base period of 1961‚1990) and precipitation (right, using the period of record). As is typical, precipitation anomalies during March 2015 varied significantly around the world . Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Ni±o is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Ni±o continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Ni±o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. El Ni±o is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Ni±o Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years. When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Ni±o conditions. Record warm temperatures continued to dominate in the northeast Pacific Ocean and were also notable in the southwest Pacific and parts of the Arctic Seas to the north and northwest of Scandinavia.

But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. ""It's a great result,"" Henderson told Sky Sports. ""The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. ""It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. ""Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. ""It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need."" In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back.

General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin. He joins a growing chorus of criticism of the refusal by any of the main parties to protect defence spending from cuts after the election, despite a pledge to increase foreign aid budgets being enshrined in law. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin . A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. Sir Peter, who retired as head of the army last summer, warned the West has been 'caught napping' amid increasing threats from the Russian Federation and Islamic State. He criticised the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) and said funding reductions were based on the assumption that there would be a 'reasonably benign security environment for this decade' following the drawdown of combat troops from Afghanistan. 'It was acknowledged that we would have less capability in an unexpected crisis than we would wish, and our political choices would be constrained,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We can now see those consequences playing out in our reticence to counter Russian expansionism, and her interference in our airspace and offshore waters.' Sir Peter called on the Government to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He wrote: 'In an era of moral and physical disarmament the West has been caught napping.' It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts. Up to 30,000 service personnel could go - with the Army likely to bear the heaviest cuts - leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade, it predicted. Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence . Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target. The leadership is braced for significant criticism over its position when a backbench business motion comes before the Commons on Thursday. Nick Clegg has claimed Mr Cameron will fail to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence because he is ideologically wedded to shrinking the state. Labour has also refused to commit to the figure, with the party's Treasury spokesman, Chris Leslie, telling the BBC: 'I know it will be difficult to keep that level of 2 per cent of GDP, but I can tell you it is absolutely impossible under the Conservative trajectory.'",39,247,"war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","Britain is being urged to stand up to expansionist Russia.

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a member of the defence select committee, called for the Joint Chiefs to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from Russia and Islamic State. Speaking at a meeting of the UK National Defence Association (UKNDA), he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle, instead of focusing their efforts on 'getting another star'. Colonel Bob Stewart, a former British commander in Bosnia, said Britain's military forces were in a 'parlous state' and could not take any further cuts . Later he said he was considering resigning himself, from either his seat or the select committee, adding: 'I'm thinking about it to be honest ‚ but that won't make any difference.' His comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 British troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an American unit as part of a high readiness reaction force. Fresh details emerged of future military operations after the head of the US army, General Raymond Odierno, said he was 'very concerned' about UK defence cuts. He told the Telegraph Britain will be demoted to a more junior role in future campaigns if spending is inadequate. David Cameron has resisted calls to make a public pledge not to cut military spending below 2 per cent - but had insisted he will not cut the size of the army any further . Former defence secretary Liam Fox has urged the Government not to cut military spending below 2 per cent . And yesterday, Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the idea of a UK brigade working under a 20,000-strong US division was 'humiliating'. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert added: 'The trouble with this is you provide the man power but with none of the authority. Why should we provide the man power ‚ some people might call it cannon fodder ‚ when what we would like to do is have a seat at the top table?' During the meeting, former military top brass put pressure on the Government to commit Britain to meeting the Nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence beyond 2016 ‚ a prospect which looks unlikely. In a blistering attack on UK military spending ‚ which has diminished as Russia's defence capabilities increase ‚ Sir Michael added: 'It is token already and if we start cutting it any more it becomes laughable.' Colonel Stewart, who commanded UN forces in Bosnia, said: 'If we are really [in] a parlous state in defence, why are the Joint Chiefs of Staff not tendering their resignations? 'They should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority, rather than getting another star.' A damning report published by the UKNDA said that if Britain is forced into a conflict with Russia, our force levels are 'pitifully small' compared to those at the end of the Cold War. An MoD spokesman said: 'We will meet the 2 per cent Nato spending target this year and next and have also committed to spending £163billion on equipment and equipment support to keep Britain safe.' General Raymond Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the US army, last week warned he was 'very concerned' about the scale of the Coalition's military cuts .",39,247,"war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.",There is backlash against the proposed cuts in military spending with many in the government calling it a disastrous undertaking.

Ben Hiscox, 30, was playing a home game for Stoke Gifford United in Bristol on Saturday when he slipped on the wet ground following the tackle and crashed into the building. The striker was knocked unconscious and rushed to intensive care for urgent treatment. But, three days later, he suffered two seizures and died in hospital. Tragic: Ben Hiscox, 30, (pictured left and right with a teammate) died yesterday, three days after hitting his head on the clubhouse wall during a home football match at Stoke Gifford United in Bristol . His team-mates had gone to secure a 4-1 victory against Mangotsfields Sports, not realising their fellow player had been fatally injured. The defender involved in the tackle was too shaken to carry on playing, the club said. Tributes have since flooded in for Mr Hiscox, who was described by his club as a 'total legend'. Close friend and club vice-chairman Ben Bennett said: 'No one is blaming anyone. It was just a tragic accident.' The incident unfolded about 55 minutes into the game as Mr Hiscox and his opponent both charged down the right wing towards the ball. As Mr Hiscox crossed the ball into the box, he was tackled by the defender and hit the floor. He then slid into the clubhouse, where his head which thrown backwards against the wall. Mr Bennett said Mr Hiscox was knocked unconscious for five minutes but managed to move himself away from the pitch. Four ambulances then rushed to the scene to take him to Southmead hospital, Bristol. In hospital, Mr Hiscox was given medication to sedate him and, by Monday, was showing signs of improvement. He was moved out of intensive care but died the next day. Mr Hiscox, who worked in insurance, leaves behind a partner and six-year-old step-daughter. 'Total legend': Mr Hiscox (pictured left and right with who is believed to be his partner), who worked in insurance, leaves behind a partner and six-year-old step-daughter . Last night, around 100 people gathered at the ground to pay tribute to Mr Hiscox. The player had been part of the amateur club since he was a teenager. Mr Bennett, 33, said: 'He was a big part of the club and the team here. 'He had been part of the club for a long time, since he was about 16. He was a total legend and one of the nicest guys I have ever met. 'Everyone that met him liked him. He was one of the nicest blokes you could know. No one had a bad word to say about him. 'He just got on with everyone. It is a sad day for the club and we're all thinking of him and his family.' Speaking about the incident, he added: 'He was running towards the byline and he went to cross the ball into the box. Collision: The striker was knocked unconscious after hitting the wall (pictured above) and rushed to intensive care for urgent treatment . Accident: His team-mates went on to secure a 4-1 victory at the ground (pictured) against Mangotsfields Sports, not realising their fellow player had been fatally injured . 'A defender went running over - they were both going for the ball. They nudged and both went down. Ben slid across the ground and hit his back on the clubhouse. The forced whipped his head backwards. 'It was just a coming together. It was no different to any other tackle really. 'He was unconscious for about five minutes. When he came to he didn't know where he was. He was being sick and people were quite worried about him. 'He managed to get up and walk over to the sideline though. An ambulance arrived in about eight minutes - they drove on to the pitch to help him.' He added: 'No one thought it would have ended up like this. The club have been playing there for nearly 10 years and nothing even close to this has ever happened. Tributes: Floral tributes have been left at the scene for the 30-year-old. Around 100 people gathered on Tuesday night at the ground to pay tribute to Mr Hiscox . Never forgotten: One touching note left at the scene read: 'You will never be forgotten by anyone'. Mr Hiscox had been part of the club since he was a teenager . 'I've been in situations like this before - you think there isn't much to it. The game stopped for about half an hour. Some players wanted to carry on while others didn't. 'The defender in the tackle didn't play for the rest of the game. He was shaken up. The other club have been really good. They were calling and emailing to check that he was okay.' Tributes also came in from former club Bristol Manor Farm FC, where Mr Hiscox played between 2008 and 2010. Manor Farm's club secretary Andy Radford said: 'He was the life and soul of the party and a brilliant guy. 'He was not only a great goal scorer, but a great guy - if you were feeling down he would cheer you up. 'He is one of the players that you just don't forget; he was an absolute all-round great bloke. 'His infectious humour always brightened up your day and made you feel better. 'My condolences are with his family and friends.

168,32RIADZISU6MKHZRF2UG2TEYWSBS49,84b727701a058446b864bb4c8cc77a113994580a,"(CNN)While the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq holds the world's gaze, a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention: the deterioration of al Qaeda. In an audio message released Sunday, al Qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders, known as Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, were killed in CIA drone strikes in January in North Waziristan, near the Afghan-Pakistan border. Farooq's real name was Raja Mohammad Suleman, al Qaeda said. He was a Pakistani who acted as the group's liaison to the Pakistan Taliban and was the deputy commander of al Qaeda's South Asia branch. (Mansur's real name was Qari Ubaidullah, a Pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan). Al Qaeda's South Asia branch is relatively new, announced with some fanfare back in September by al Qaeda's top leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The creation of the terror group's South Asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from ISIS, which is embroiled in a public dispute with al Qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement. The deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al Qaeda's bench of leaders. On Monday, in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, local al Qaeda commander Nurul Hassan was killed in a raid, said Arif Hanif, district inspector general of police. Florida-raised Adnan Shukrijumah, 39, who was in charge of al Qaeda's operations to attack the West, was killed in December in a Pakistani military operation. Texas-born Mohanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, who also played a planning role for al Qaeda's operations, was arrested in Pakistan last year. The deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al Qaeda left except al-Zawahiri. Both Ubaidullah and Suleman were Pakistani. This is an indicator of how al Qaeda has become a largely Pakistan-focused group, increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of Pakistan or Afghanistan. Indeed, al Qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the West. The last successful al Qaeda attack in the West was the London transportation system bombings a decade ago. Al Qaeda is now reduced only to holding American hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker Warren Weinstein, who was kidnapped from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore on August 13, 2011. To be sure, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, continues to pose a threat to American aviation. The group has built hard-to-detect bombs, which it has placed on U.S.-bound flights. Luckily, those bombs were faulty or were detected. The group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, killing 12, but it's not clear if AQAP had any direct role in planning this attack. Meanwhile, ISIS continues to attract Western recruits and also inspire ""homegrown"" terrorists in the West, but the core al Qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men, women and children on 9/11 is on life support. Al Qaeda's confirmation of the deaths of Ubaidullah and Suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment.",12,64,"islamic, terror, terrorist, al, threat, iraq, attacks, terrorists, terrorism, threats,","group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","terrorist attack, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threat, extremist groups","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","This topic is about terrorist attacks, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threats, and extremist groups.","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","Two of the topmost Al Qaeda leaders, Ustad Ahmad Farooq and Qari Abdullah Mansur, responsible for organizing multiple terrorist attacks were killed in January.

171,32Q90QCQ1UN6O0JCZZXRKTZFTJJEK4,2c3a3bb94797e2069cb771ddf165f2387cbc24c2,"The new 4G mobile phone services in the UK are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse. The mobile phone companies boasted that 4G services would be 'five times faster' than the existing 3G networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012. However, a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9Mbit/s per second on the 3G service that most people use. A study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised. Mobile phone companies boasted 4G would be five times faster than 3G. But the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second. Shown is an HTC One XL smartphone at a news conference in Zurich launching 4G in 2012 . At the same time, the evidence suggests that 4G services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them. 4G technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering. More than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of £20 ($30) a month. The 4G speed data comes from the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the 3G services. Despite this, the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - EE, O2, Vodafone and Three - promised. Ofcom's research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE's 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s. This looks good when compared with its 3G service, which was a slow 4Mbit/s. Second fastest was Vodafone with 16.4 for 4G versus 6.6 for 3G. O2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6, followed by Three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4G which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3G. Upload speeds are important when sharing content, such as pictures and videos to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. EE was also fastest on this measure at 17.6Mbit/s, followed by O2 on 13.2, Vodafone on 13.1 and Three with 9.4. The Three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds, compared to 0.71 for O2, 0.76 for Vodafone and 0.77 for EE. There is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by 4G are slowing down. When 4G services launched at the end of 2012, the average download speed was up at around 19 Mbit/s, however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10. This has happened because more people are using the service, effectively causing jams on the airwaves. The only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones. Ofcom's research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE's 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s . The Ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle and Poole/Bournemouth - between October and December. Its study found that download speeds in Edinburgh fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year. The time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72. Ofcom admitted: 'As more people are taking 4G services from the mobile operators, this is likely to affect the average speeds being received.' The speeds for London were unchanged over the same period, while there was no data for the other areas. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's Consumer Director, said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service. He said: 'People are increasingly connected, communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about. '4G is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and, as these services roll out across the UK, our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs.'",245,247,"facebook, mobile, phone, network, samsung, screen, apps, smart, ad, watch,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","mobile phone, Facebook app, social network, smart watch, Samsung phone screen, apps containing ads, watching ads","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","This topic is about mobile phones and social networking such as the Facebook app, smart watches, as well as apps containing ads that can be watched on phone screens like Samsung.","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","New phone services in the UK aren't as fast as the companies claimed they would be. 4G services are only about 2.5 times faster than 3G services, although they were claimed to be 5 times faster. 4G services are bound to slow down the more people connect to them.",People will have to increase their budget for phone and internet services to best fit their needs. As speeds slow down people will have to pay more for faster phone and internet services. As taxes rise people will have less money in general especially for their end of year/beginning of year budgets.

174,3L4PIM1GQVIQH9DYPKIIS8D97VARYY,dfea7a09613642f43b58623e0557bfeb8fccc1bd,"(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.  Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again. James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that ""continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."" Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it. This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation. EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. First, EPA's ""Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan"" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan. This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050. EPA's implementation modeling, ""Option 1 -- State,"" shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050. In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer. Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants. The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free. Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others. Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050. This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement. This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order ""Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,"" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors. While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there. The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.",55,100,"energy, power, heat, plant, fuel, waste, plants, produce, solar, produced,","earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","power plant, use fuel to produce heat, solar energy, fossil fuels produce waste","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","This topic is about power plants, using fuel to produce heat, fossil fuels that produce waste, and solar energy.","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","If there has ever been a doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Energy Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, then you need to look at how they treat nuclear energy. President Barack Obama's climate plan, supposedly aimed at reducing overall US carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, expand power plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. In a recent hearing at the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Council, told Congress that the EPA had reviewed California's Global Warming Solutions Act in developing its so-called Clean Energy Plan that the EPA plan adopts the same policy choices - limited credit for nuclear or hydropower - both carbon-free.","If there was any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Energy Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, then you should look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest carbon-free energy source, generating more than 60% of our carbon-free electricity. surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, supposedly aimed at reducing overall US carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, increase plant construction, and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. That is, the EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially extinct by 2050. These assumptions are very important because they show how emission targets are set and which state actions will receive credit for those targets. Some graduate students at the University of Tennessee made it for the EPA at a public hearing last summer. Congress didn't give the EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they hid them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the elimination of nuclear power coincidentally shows a robust development of renewable energy emwithout any retirements between now and 2050."

The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States. It comes as the Tories were buoyed by the news that inflation remains at zero per cent, with food and fuel prices down sharply year on year. Britain is on course to be the second fastest growing major economy in the world, in a major boost for George Osborne. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States . Low oil prices are expected to help bolster steady growth in the UK. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF predicted world growth of 3.5 per cent this year, unchanged from its previous projection in January. Its forecast for UK growth this year remains at 2.7 per cent though for next year it is cut from 2.4 per cent to 2.3 per cent. It said: 'In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth.' Chancellor George Osborne told MailOnline: 'These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working. 'But this growth, and the jobs and security it brings, would all be put at risk with the chaos of an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government. 'So we must keep on working through our economic plan and finish the job. 'This is the only way to deliver an economy that offers working people security at every stage of their lives.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power. He urged voters to 'see this plan through and Britain will keep exporting, growing, job-creating, and yes ‚ we'll be back in the black but only if Conservatives are back in Government'. He added: 'The next five years are much, much more important than the past five. Because having rescued our economy and set Britain back on her feet, now is our chance to truly finish the job, to make this a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can enjoy a good life.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power . The IMF said global expansion this year 'will be driven by a rebound in advanced economies supported by the decline in oil prices'. But global prospects were 'uneven' with growth slipping back in emerging economies. There would be weaker activity for some major oil exporters, with the Russian economy - also hit by tensions over Ukraine - expected to shrink by 3.8 per cent this year, worse than the previously estimated 3 per cent. The IMF said that while risks to global growth 'are now more balanced' than six months ago, they 'remain tilted to the downside'. These included the danger of low inflation in countries saddled by high debt, with the warning coming on the same day that official figures showed inflation falling to minus 0.01 per cent in the UK. Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning . Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning. It means that in the 12 months to March family living costs have not risen at all ‚ while at the same time people's pay jumped by 1.8 per cent. Prices are being held down by the falling cost of food, fuel and women's clothes, the office for national statistics said this morning. Petrol prices fell by 13.7 per cent over the year to March, but saw a slight increase between February and March. The average petrol price rose by 3.8p per litre between February and March. The biggest price falls came from clothing and footwear which fell by 0.1 per cent between February and March. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since month-on-month inflation was first measured. Normally prices rise as they recover following the January sales period. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: 'A number of complex forces are shaping the prospects around the world. 'Legacies of both the financial and euro area crises - weak banks and high levels of public, corporate, and household debt - are still weighing on spending and growth in some countries.' The outlook for the US this year has been slashed by 0.5 per cent to 3.1 per cent while for the eurozone it has been upgraded from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, helped by low oil prices and a weaker single currency amid a 1.1 trillion euro (£790 billion) stimulus programme. The IMF still said conditions were ripe for 'robust US economic performance in 2015' but pointed to risks such as the strong dollar hitting exports and the low oil price suppressing investment in that sector. It said macroeconomic risks to global growth, such as a recession in the eurozone, had slightly decreased, but that financial and geopolitical risks had increased. The latter included below-target inflation in countries with high debt and low growth since the financial crisis, with little room to provide more monetary stimulus. The report said: 'Stagnation and low inflation in advanced economies, notwithstanding the recent upgrade to the near-term growth forecasts for some of these economies, could hamper the recovery.' It said prospects for some economies were 'clouded' by ageing populations, weak investment and lacklustre productivity growth as well as high debt both among governments and in the private sector. The report added: 'Inflation and inflation expectations in most advanced economies are below target and are in some cases still declining - a particular concern for countries with crisis legacies of high debt and low growth, and little or no room to ease monetary policy.' Financial risks could also include a further surge in the US dollar and strong market reactions as 'accommodative' monetary policies supporting recovery - such as low interest rates and money printing - start to be withdrawn. Geopolitical risks included tensions 'stemming from ongoing events in Ukraine, the Middle East and West Africa' which 'could generate regional and global spillover'.",110,247,"billion, figures, economy, global, growth, economic, number, countries, numbers, expected,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","economic growth, global growth, billion dollar figures, economy is growing, expected growth","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people",This topic is about economic growth involving billion dollar figures showing that the economy is growing as expected globally.,"This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","Britain's economy continues to grow.

Instead, she's flying coach and toting her own luggage. A United Airlines regional jet carried her back to the East Coast on Thursday from the Omaha, Nebraska airport. Her flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, the major airport most convenient to her spacious Chappaqua, New York home. A reporter with the liberal news outlet Vox tweeted a photo of Clinton toting her own luggage on Thursday in Omaha . SHE'S JUST LIKE US? A Town Car sedan (right) met Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac in Newark on Thursday, flanked by police and Secret Service vehicles . Hillary Clinton took the fast route home from Iowa to the East Coast: just a 3-hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time . Clinton had just finished a three-day presidential campaign swing in Council Bluffs, Iowa. That's just a few miles away, and home to a cafe where she held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand. In contrast with the private jet service Hillary has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours, her ride home was a no-frills commercial flight without a First Class seat to be found anywhere. For flights from Omaha to Newark, United uses Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets with nothing but narrow economy-class seats. END OF AN ERA? Scooby's first trip ended with a total of 10 confirmed sightings and more than 1,300 miles driven . Clinton flew back East on an EMbraer ERJ-series plane like this one . EASIER TO RUB ELBOWS: The aircraft Mrs. Clinton took home has narrow chairs and the whole plane is economy class, but at least there's no middle seat . Hillary's handlers have been trying to reposition her as an 'everywoman' eager to meet with ordinary people. But her first Iowa event, promoted as a spontaneous coffee shop sit-down with average voters, turned out to be a carefully staged production whose young participants were driven to the cafe by Clinton's Iowa political director. At least three of the 'everyday Americans' featured in Hillary's campaign launch video have ties to Democratic Party politics. And hours before her flight, Secret Service agents parked the now-familiar 'Scooby' van in a handicapped spot so she would have a shorter walk. On Thursday a Vox reporter photographed Hillary at Omaha's Eppley Field airport, holding on to her own rollaboard luggage and talking with a member of the public. But while she boarded the plane like everyone else, she didn't disembark that way: Afellow passenger tweeted a photo of the Town Car sedan ‚ and police escort ‚ that awaited her in Newark on the airport tarmac. Just one person tweeted that Clinton was on their plane, not unlike her Ohio lunch at Chipotle where no one recognized her . EMBARRASSING: U.S. Secret Service parked 'Scooby' in a handicapped space Thursday while Clinton held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party officials . It's not clear how Clinton's twin 'Scooby' vans, her armored and customized campaign vehicles, will get back to Chappaqua. The Secret Service did not respond to a request for comment. Agents will likely have to drive the vehicles back themselves. If Hillary were the American president, they would be rolled aboard Air Force One and flown east.

""I think there's a third alternative, and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal,"" Netanyahu told CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday on ""State of the Union."" His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. But GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility. On Sunday, the sparring continued. One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to ""contain himself."" And a top Republican said almost any of Obama's successors as president ""could do better."" Netanyahu's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to Washington, when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it's implemented. ""It does not roll back Iran's nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,"" Netanyahu said Sunday. ""That's a very bad deal. "" Netanyahu said Iran is a country of ""congenital cheating"" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama. ""I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful,"" Netanyahu said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu ""would contain himself."" The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States, as well as Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- are ""on the cusp of something that can be workable."" ""It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,"" Feinstein said. ""But I don't think it's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world."" Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the ""breakout"" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the ""almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal."" ""We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,"" he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on ""Face the Nation"" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a ""new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama."" And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal.

The black humor of the message provides some light relief for a school that lives in constant fear of a terrorist attack because of what is taught inside its walls. The students (aged 8 to 14) at the Ibnu-Siina school in northern Kenya are getting a so-called ""Western"" education, taking lessons in subjects like mathematics, science and English. But it's an education that Al-Shabaab -- the Somali-based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining, according to the head of the school. ""These men, Al-Shabaab, want to make sure everything goes negative,"" headmaster James Ndonye told CNN. ""They want to make sure they terrify the teachers so they go to their homes -- so the kids in this area don't get what they deserve."" Al-Shabaab militants have launched a series of deadly attacks over the last few years in the region mostly targeting Christians. Many of the math and science teachers in this area are Christian. In early April, Al-Shabaab brutally massacred 147 people at Garissa University in northern Kenya. It was the group's deadliest attack to date. The gunmen would have driven down the road past the Ibnu-Siina school -- and its single unarmed guard -- to get to the university, only a few hundred meters away. Kenyan teachers and students alike are terrified. ""The University College of Garissa was the only and first university college in northern Kenya. We were happy when we got it a few years ago,"" explained Garissa Regional Governor Nadif Jama. ""Today it has been closed. That is Al-Shabaab's mission,"" Jama said. ""That is what they want. And that is nothing but destroying the fabric of our being a civilized society."" And it's not just in Kenya. Terrorist groups across the Sahel region are waging war on schools, teachers and students. In northeast Nigeria, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has been waging war against the government -- and the civilian population -- for several years. Most notoriously, perhaps, was Boko Haram's kidnapping of around 270 girls from a boarding school in Chibok, Borno state, last April. But the group has also carried out numerous other attacks on schools, slaughtering young boys and girls as they sleep in their dormitories. Last year in Garissa, James Ndonye lost five of his 11 teachers amid rising fears of an Al-Shabaab attack on the school. He replaced them, but it wasn't easy. Yet despite the ever-present threat of terror, Ndonye has stayed to help the children. ""I risk my life because -- for this class, there's a target we have for last year ... and I love that class very much,"" Ndonye said.

Under the tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has announced on Sunday that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016. Meanwhile, families who do vaccinate their kids are eligible for the $7,500-a-year childcare rebate, $200-a-week childcare benefit and the $726 Family Tax Benefit Part A end of year supplement. Scroll down for video . The government has announced they will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . The 'conscientious objector' exemption on children's vaccination has been effective since the Howard Government, but after meeting with religious organisations, Mr Morrison said payments will be cut off if parents don't immunise their kids. 'We have had discussions with the Church of Christ, Scientist and have formed the view that this exemption is no longer current or necessary and will therefore be removed,' Minister Morrison said. 'Having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members, the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn. 'Having resolved this outstanding matter the government will not be receiving nor authorising any further vaccination exemption applications from religious organisations. 'The only authorised exemption from being required to have children immunised in order to receive benefits is on medical grounds. 'While parents have the right to decide to not vaccinate their children, if they are doing so as a vaccination objector, they are no longer eligible for assistance from the Australian Government.' Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison has announced the end to religious exemption on children's vaccinations for access to childcare benefits . Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child . The announcement comes after Mr Morrison said while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated.

Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, 29, was deported from Pakistan to the United States. He's accused of plotting to fight against American forces abroad, according to a complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. ""This is news for celebration,"" said CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd. ""Pretty simple reason why: If you look at a case like this, I think most Americans would say the significance of this case is that this guy, an American, is going to come back home and conduct an attack. Instead, you should look at him as a ... facilitator. ""He's not going to burn himself by coming back. He's going to serve as the conduit or known in Pakistan who understands the West, how you travel, how you stay out of the clutches of law enforcement and he also understands al Qaeda in Pakistan. Those people are really hard to come by. This is a great catch not because he was a potential bomber but because he could have trained tens of bombers."" Farekh's court appearance comes on the same day that federal prosecutors announced the arrests of two New York women accused of planning to build an explosive device for an attack on U.S. soil. The women, identified as Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in a plot inspired by the terrorist group ISIS and others to build a weapon of mass destruction, according to a criminal complaint. They are both U.S. citizens and were roommates in the borough of Queens. Farekh allegedly departed from Canada and headed to Pakistan with two other men in 2007 with the intention of fighting American forces abroad, prosecutors said. In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups. Of those cases, 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS. ""Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,' "" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday. ""The terrorist threat is more decentralized, more diffuse, more complicated. It involves the potential lone wolf actor, it involves the effective use of social media, the Internet."" A Texas native, Farekh and his co-conspirators allegedly conspired to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda from 2006 to 2009, according to the complaint. Their intention, according to court documents: To kill and attempt to kill U.S. government employees and military personnel abroad. ""Al Farekh allegedly provided material support to terrorists with every intention of becoming a martyr,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Diego Rodriguez said in a statement. ""Today, members of our military are safer."" When Farekh, another man named Ferid Imam and a third co-conspirator left Canada for Pakistan in 2007, they did not inform their families of their plans, court documents said. The three men were enrolled as students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Prosecutors said they called a friend in Canada after arriving in Pakistan to say that they would not be heard from again because they were becoming martyrs. In September 2008, Imam allegedly provided weapons and other military training at an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan to three men -- Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin. The trio had planned to return to the United States to carry out a suicide attack on the New York subway, according to prosecutors. Zazi and Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors. They have not been sentenced. Medunjanin was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Imam has been indicted for his role in the plot. If convicted, Farekh faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

The mother of three teenagers who ran away to Syria to wage jihad says her sons were 'brainwashed' by YouTube videos and their extremist friends. Inas Abulsayen was left heartbroken when her sons left their home in Sussex and travelled to fight with a branch of Al Qaeda against the Assad regime. Her two younger sons Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes have now been killed in the war-torn country, and she has launched a public appeal for their older brother Amer to come home. Amer, 20, left the family home in Saltdean, near Brighton, in October 2013 and joined the Al Nusra Front, and two months later his brothers joined him in Syria. In April last year, 18-year-old Abdullah was killed in a battle which also left Amer injured, and in October Jaffar died while fighting against Assad's troops in December. Despite his brothers' deaths, Amer is determined to remain in the Middle East, and has ignored his family's demands for him to return to Britain. Mrs Abulsayen said her sons were influenced by radical videos which they watched online, and insisted that she and her husband Abubaker were opposed to extremism. 'My sons went to serve, to sacrifice, and now two of them are dead,' she said. 'They were victims. They felt England was a part of their lives, but everybody has a secret life. 'We have our religion, but there is lots of brainwashing on YouTube, in the mosques, through friends. 'My sons are Muslim, and they believe everyone should be free as part of humanity. I taught them about the uprising, but not about fighting, maybe they thought they are men and maybe they were brainwashed.' Scroll down for video . Killed: Abdullah, left, and Jaffar, right, both died fighting in Syria for the Al Nusra Front, a branch of Al Qaeda . Home: The three brothers abandoned the family house in Saltdean, Sussex to fight in Syria . The mother of six said that her sons' friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, influenced them with his radical views when he was staying with them after falling out with his own family. Mrs Abulsayen said: 'I had lots of arguments with him because he talked about Osama Bin Laden, jihad - and I didn't want my sons in this position. He had a bad view on Islam. 'I heard Ibrahim say to Jaffar, ""You are not young now, Jaffar. You are old enough, you can look after yourself.""' Kamara died in a US air strike in Aleppo last year after travelling to Syria with Jaffar. Mrs Abulsayen added that her sons told her they wanted to carry out humanitarian missions but instead turned to jihad once they arrived in Syria. 'Amer was the first one to leave in October 2013,' she said. 'He said to me, ""Mummy, there is a community that has English people who want to help refugees. This is my chance. Let me make that trip. It's not that dangerous."" 'He said to me, ""Mummy, I feel guilty. I have food, I have everything here - don't be upset with me. This is the best opportunity for me. People are hungry and children are crying."" 'He is very calm, like all my sons, and he gave me a promise he would be back. He said it was just a trip to help refugees. ''If I die, you will be upset if I am martyred', he said to me. I said of course - you know my opinion on going to Syria - I disagree with it.' Father: Abubaker Deghayes outside his home in October, announcing that Jaffar had been killed . Uncle: Omar Deghayes spent five years as a detainee in Guantanamo Bay before being released . Three months later, her two other sons left without telling their family where they were going, she said. 'Abdullah, the first one to die, I didn't even get to give him a hug before he left,' she continued. He didn't say goodbye to me. Abdullah left and gave his sister a hug before saying, ""I'm going to meet my mate."" 'Two weeks before he left, Jaffar told me he would never leave me, so I don't know who brainwashed him. Maybe he thought he could get his brothers back, I don't know.' The boys' uncle, Omar Deghayes, was a detainee at Guantanamo Bay for five years after being arrested in Pakistan, but was eventually released without charge. In a film shot last year, Amer insisted he would not return home, saying: 'My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.' He added: 'The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.'

193,3OS46CRSLH1GRWK9SLS0AEIJTVYV67,20396a711f422075b42dde4da59cc5d3a1f391fe,"The Baltimore Police Department has used secret cellphone surveillance equipment 4,300 times since 2007 - amid claims it is ordered to withhold such evidence from prosecutors, a court heard. A detective from the department said officers used a device called Hailstorm, which can identify phones from a 360-degree antenna from about a city block away. Police use it to trace stolen phones or to find people. The details, revealed in court, resemble the original plot of HBO's hit series The Wire, the crime drama based in the same city, which featured electronic surveillance of drug dealers. Baltimore Police used cellphone surveillance equipment 4,300 times since 2007, a court heard. The case resembles parts of the plot of The Wire (pictured), which featured electronic surveillance of drug dealers . Testifying on Wednesday, Baltimore police Detective Emmanuel Cabreja said the department is under orders by the US government to withhold evidence from criminal trials and to ignore subpoenas in cases where the device is used. Cabreja said under questioning from defense attorneys that he did not comply with a subpoena to bring the device to court because of a nondisclosure agreement between the Baltimore police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 'Does it instruct you to withhold evidence from the state's attorney and the circuit court of Baltimore city, even if upon order to produce?' asked defense attorney Joshua Insley. 'Yes,' Cabreja replied, saying he spoke with the FBI last week about the case. The Baltimore case surrounds a carjacking and robbery. Nicholas West and his co-defendant, a juvenile, pleaded guilty on Wednesday. Yet the case, like a handful of others in the city, has raised questions among defense attorneys and even a circuit court judge over the use of the cellphone-tracking equipment. The Hailstorm, made by Florida-based Harris Corp., can sweep up cellphone subscriber-identity data by tricking phones into thinking it's a cell tower. It is an upgraded version of the Stingray surveillance device. Hailstorm is an upgraded version of the Stingray surveillance device (pictured) manufactured by Harris Corporation, of Melbourne, Florida . That data is then transmitted to the police, allowing them to locate a phone without the user even making a call or sending a text message. 'This is a very expensive and very invasive technology developed for military use, now used on the streets of America,' said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has fought for the release of these types of records. 'The public has a right to know how taxpayer dollars are being spent, and if our constitutional rights are being respected,' he said. The FBI declined to immediately answer questions about the case last night. Police across the country have largely been kept silent on how they use the devices. A detective from Baltimore (pictured) said officers used a device called Hailstorm, which can identify phones from a 360-degree antenna from about a city block away in distance . Because documents about Stingrays and Hailstorms are regularly censored in public records requests by citizens and journalists, it is not entirely clear what information the devices could capture - such as the contents of phone conversations and text messages, what they routinely capture based on how they are configured, or how often they might be used. Cabreja said Hailstorm can identify phones from an antenna from about a city block away in distance. He said no content, such as text messages or phone conversations, is captured in the process. Some judges have pushed back against state and local government agencies in criminal trials and freedom-of-information requests involving the surveillance devices. In Baltimore, Circuit Judge Barry Williams presided over an earlier trial in which the police apparently used a surveillance device to collect evidence on a robbery suspect. At a November 2014 hearing, Williams lost his patience with a state prosecutor after a police technician wouldn't answer a defense attorney's questions about the device - citing the same FBI nondisclosure agreement. 'You don't have a nondisclosure agreement with the court,' Williams told police Detective John Haley, part of the department's advanced technical team. 'Answer the question.' The prosecutors instead withdrew the evidence, avoiding a contempt citation and questions about the equipment's use.",195,144,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","online, users, internet, site, device, people, computer, iphone, data, devices,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","online internet users, people check websites on different devices, using an iPhone App to surf the internet, computer devices, data plans","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about online internet users, using an iPhone app to surf the internet, computer devices, data plans, and people checking a website on different devices.","The Baltimore police department has used secret cellphone survellance equipment 4,300 times. the mportent one is digital life.The datails relevant in the court,resemvble the original plot of HBO hit The Wire.The Hailstorm,made by Florida-based Harns corp.","The documents about Stingrays and Hailstorms are regularcensored in public records request by citizen and journalists.

An emotional Holder, who has served as the nation's top law enforcement official since the start of the Obama administration, addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members one day after his successor, Loretta Lynch, was confirmed by the Senate following a months-long delay. 'I am proud of you. I'm going to miss you. I am going to miss this building. I am going to miss this institution. More than anything, I am going to miss you all,' Holder told the standing-room-only crowd, many of whom embraced him after he concluded his speech. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Attorney General Eric Holder waved to Justice Department employees during his farewell gathering in Washington on Friday, ending six years at the DOJ . Holder shook hands and received hugs from well-wishers on his last day as attorney general . Newly confirmed Attorney General-designate Loretta Lynch will take over from Holder, following a months-long delay of her Senate confirmation vote ‚ which passed on Thursday with 'yes' votes from 10 Republicans . The event also included a tribute video prepared for the occasion that featured members of Congress, former President Bill Clinton and Holder's wife, Sharon Malone. In it, Holder described an 'emotional attachment' to the department and recounted efforts to protect civil rights, prosecute terror suspects in federal court and change the criminal justice system. Other clips showed President Barack Obama showering Holder with praise on the day Holder announced his departure. Holder, a former judge and U.S. attorney who took the job in 2009, will exit the department as the third-longest serving attorney general in U.S. history. He has not publicly announced what he'll be doing next. After Lynch, 55, is sworn in at the Justice Department on Monday, she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as Holder as the Obama administration draws to a close. But she is expected to bring to Washington her own management style and has spoken optimistically about having cooperative relationships with Congress following years of bitter feuding with Republicans who saw Holder as overly political and once held him in contempt. Holder's tenure was in many ways defined by his efforts on civil rights protections. His department challenged state laws that it saw as restricting access to the voting booth and refused to defend the constitutionality of a federal law banning recognition of gay marriage.

Though Holder sees civil rights as a defining element of his legacy, his early years largely centered on national security concerns as the country confronted several terror plots, including a failed effort to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. MOBBED: Holder's jubilant reception from his staff was the polar opposite of his treatment at the hands of congressional Republicans . Media advocates criticized the Justice Department's aggressive stance in news media leak investigations involving national security cases, and human rights groups expressed frustration when the department failed to bring charges over harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects. One area where he has professed vindication is in his plan to transfer terror suspects from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to the United States for prosecution in the federal court system. The plan was abandoned amid congressional opposition, but since then, the Justice Department has pointed to successful terror convictions in American courts even as the military tribunal system has slogged along without major results. On Friday, he called that debate 'dead' and settled and said it was now clear that civilian courts could adequately handle national security investigations.",46,162,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","Attorney General Eric Holder bade farewell to the Department of Justice on Friday after six years, describing what he said were its main accomplishments and telling officials they helped produce a 'golden age' in the department's history.

195,31JLPPHS2WWM4TOU878O8JCRL3M3OC,d8f67e870e3321c17d8a2081fbcc7eb4bca24035,"Washington (CNN)Rick Santorum says he'd hoped Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would veto the ""fix"" to his state's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope. The law unleashed an intense backlash against Indiana, led by tech giants like Apple and Salesforce and sports organizations like the NCAA, amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers. Santorum, the former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Pence's decision to sign a follow-up bill -- which made clear the law couldn't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a ""limited view"" of religious freedom. ""It doesn't really open the debate up on some of the more current issues,"" Santorum said -- a reference to gay rights issues. With the Supreme Court set to rule in June on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized nationwide, social conservatives like Santorum have asserted that Christian bakers, florists and wedding photographers shouldn't be forced to provide their services to same-sex weddings. The Indiana uproar drew nearly all of the GOP's 2016 contenders into the debate, with candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz rushing to Pence's defense. ""Tolerance is a two-way street,"" Santorum said. ""If you're a print shop and you are a gay man, should you be forced to print 'God hates fags' for the Westboro Baptist Church because they hold those signs up?"" Santorum said. ""Should the government force you to do that?"" he said. ""And that's what these cases are all about. This is about the government coming in saying, 'No -- we're going to make you do this.' And this is where I think we just need some space to say, 'Let's have some tolerance -- have it be a two-way street.'"" Gay rights groups, meanwhile, have used the outrage over Indiana's law -- as well as a similar one that Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaign's legal director, said the debate could shift to states like Texas and South Carolina, where similar bills have been introduced. She said tech companies like Facebook and Google are increasingly wading into the debate because they're recognizing that ""nondiscrimination protections are critical to every area of their employees' lives."" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of the Catholic archdiocese in New York, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a ""delicate balance."" ""We've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely, the rights of people not to be discriminated against,"" he said. ""It's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is, today, the more popular issues,"" Dolan said. ""In a way, I appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like Gov. Pence that are saying, 'Whoa, wait a minute. Without questioning the rights of the gay community, we also have to make sure that the rights of the religious community are protected.'"" ""I just wish we could do that in a temperate, civil way, instead of screaming at each other,"" he said.",46,113,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.",The discussion is about the legality of same sex marriage and the churches involvment by voicing it's opinion about it.

196,3137ONMDKI71MENT98CCM17MM2VEGU,0dc6506917122391fe53e18938666f91373a8efb,"(CNN)The best part of the Supreme Court oral arguments about marriage equality was when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to S&M. OK, she didn't actually mention S&M, but Ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago, when it was ""a dominant and a subordinate relationship."" ""Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled,"" said Ginsburg. ""It was her obligation to follow him."" Mary Bonauto, the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the Supreme Court, said in response: ""That's correct. ... For centuries we had and Europe had this coverture system where a woman's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles. And again, because of equality and changing social circumstances, all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated."" Once upon a time, wives were the legal property of their husbands and ""marital rape"" was not only not a crime but not even a concept. To argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naØve. Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines, at one point referred to ""the nobility and the sacredness of marriage."" Which is true, if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present. If anything, the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people. One downside to arguing that marriage has ""always been"" between a man and a woman is that, therefore, any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples, too. The one justice who didn't ask a question is Clarence Thomas, who, with one slight exception, has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench. It should be carefully noted here that Thomas is a black man married to a white woman. Anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in Maryland. That means that by 1967, when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of such laws, bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the American ""definition"" of marriage for over 300 years. Just 20 years after the Supreme Court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states, Clarence Thomas and his wife, Virginia, were married. James Braxton Peterson, director of Africana Studies at Lehigh University, has written, ""The fact that the Thomas' marriage required progressive Supreme Court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment."" Or maybe not. Clarence Thomas didn't say one way or the other, though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he's firmly opposed to the Supreme Court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own. But perhaps the example of Clarence Thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases, namely that just as with the rest of America, the Supreme Court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics. Perhaps this was always the case, justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales. Still, the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law. On the one hand, pulling pages right from Republican presidential candidates, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts suggested the court shouldn't intervene in a state-driven social debate. Aping conservative religious activists, Justice Samuel Alito asked whether four people could then get married. On the other hand, Justice Stephen Breyer talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while Justice Elena Kagan pushed back on whether legalizing same-sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite-sex couples. Both arguments, and the moral force beneath them, seemed to echo gay rights messaging. Still, the highly political and momentous decision in Loving vs. Virginia was unanimous. Whichever way the court rules on same-sex marriage, it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous. So, while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved, a fact hopefully the Supreme Court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality, what's also clear is that the court has evolved. Blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up America in general, the Supreme Court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics. The question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision ‚î I think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment. The question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other.",46,78,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","court, judge, case, appeal, justice, order, ruling, ruled, magistrates, ordered,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","a court ruling, department of justice, appealed against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, court order, magistrates","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about a court ruling, department of justice, appealing against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, a court order, and magistrates.",The article describes the fight for marriage equality.

Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team.

'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc's life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week.

Should Pep Guardiola's side go all the way and claim this season's title as European champions, Alonso will become only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan. Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teams . Alonso in action during Bayern Munich's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last week . It is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told The Telegraph. 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid.

The deadly attack on the prominent Bardo Museum near Tunisia's parliament in the country's capital, Tunis, is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death, a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years, including in North Africa. Such attacks mimic the 2008 Mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from Pakistan went on a rampage in the massive Indian port city. They took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period, in an attack that drew sustained global TV coverage. The gunmen attacked iconic Mumbai targets such as the Taj hotel, which is frequented by Westerners. The Mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a ""fedayeen"" mission -- meaning ""those who sacrifice themselves"" -- and that they would probably fight to the death. Only one gunman survived. In this week's Tunisia attack, the gunmen took hostages, two gunmen died in the assault, and three survived and are being hunted by the Tunisian government. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said the attackers at the Bardo Museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country's economy. This seems a likely outcome of the attack, as tourism is vital to Tunisia's economy, providing 15% of GDP. Tunisia is also the only country where the Arab Spring produced a successful, lasting democratic transition, making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like Egypt, which did not weather the Arab Spring as well as Tunisia. Already, some tour companies are canceling excursions to Tunis. In January, in Tunisia's neighbor Libya, the local branch of ISIS mounted a similar attack on the upscale Corinthia Hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Two gunmen, one of them a Tunisian, killed 10 people, including an American. Both gunmen died in the attack. This attack served ISIS' purposes of sowing greater instability in Libya and expunging Western influence from the country, as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed. A senior US official told one of us that the U.S. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS now control a twelfth of the landmass of Libya, which is one of the largest countries on the African continent. This is a sobering finding for Tunisia, which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued Libya and other North African countries. While the museum attack in Tunisia and the hotel attack in Libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals, more often than not, armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels, supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem. In September 2013, Al-Shabaab, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Four gunmen carried out the attack, which unspooled over a four-day period. The Westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the Kenyan government, which had sent troops to Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. However, a year and a half after the attack on the mall, Al-Shabaab continues to lose territory in Somalia, and the Kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group. The plague of Mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to Africa. In January, Mumbai-style tactics were used in Paris when Cherif and Said Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period. All three gunmen were killed. In a videotape, Coulibaly said ISIS inspired him. The Paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on France's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against ISIS.",129,12,"attack, attacks, killed, attacked, bomb, people, explosion, bombing, injured, blast,","islamic, terror, terrorist, al, threat, iraq, attacks, terrorists, terrorism, threats,","bomb explosion attack, killed in a bombing attack, injured in the blast, the explosion was caused by a bomb, people behind the attack, car bomb killed and wounded people","terrorist attack, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threat, extremist groups","This topic is about a bomb explosion attack, people killed in a bombing attack, or injured in the blast, an explosion caused by a bomb, people behind the attack, a car bombing killing and wounding people.","This topic is about terrorist attacks, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threats, and extremist groups.","On Wednesday, gunmen took hostages in Tunisia and killed 23 people.

The Lowy Institute report, released on Thursday, says the large number of Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq represents a 'serious national security threat' but that the risk of an attack on home soil could be mitigated by the right policy response. The new report comes just a day after the news of the death of Melbourne model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama. The Australian was reportedly killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State. Scroll down for video . A report on the threat posed by Australian foreign fighters has blamed the Abbott government's troubled relations with the Muslim community for worsening the situation . Melbourne'sSharky Jama was reportedly shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State last year . Mohamed Elomar (above) is a boxer-turned-terrorist who fled Sydney to join the Islamic State in Syria . The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Khaled Sharrouf's fled to Syria from western Sydney. His 14-year-old daughter married Mohamed Elomar . Sharrouf posted a photo last year of his son holding up a severed head, causing international uproar . The new report outlines how returned fighters pose a serious threat to Australians. 'Returned foreign fighters have been involved in many of the most serious jihadist plots in the West, including in Australia,' the report says. 'Returnees from Syria have already engaged in terrorist plots in Europe, and the large number of Australians involved with groups such as IS (Islamic State) and Jabhat al-Nusra raises well-founded fears of an increased threat at home.' While much of the responsibility in dealing with the threat will lie with the police and intelligence services, the report says, it adds that programs aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE) need to be a core element of the response. The report says 'questions remain' as to how any new CVE approach will be implemented by the government, and that 'troubled relations with Australia's Muslim communities mean that its efforts to counter violent extremism are not off to the strongest of starts'. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Australian Mahmoud Adullatif, who is known as the 'Playboy Jihadi', died recently while fighting for IS . Melbourne woman Zehra Duman (pictured above) was married to Abdullatif and has threatened Australia . A successful CVE approach should draw on the talent that already exists within relevant communities, the report said, but that 'community co-operation has been undermined' by a lack of information about changes to the government's approach, including funding of grant schemes. 'Moreover, the poor consultation by the government with the Muslim community on much of Australia's new counter-terrorism legislation as well as the Prime Minister's (Tony Abbott) claim that Muslim leaders are not doing enough to speak out against radical ideas have undermined the prospects for effective co-operation.' The report said the Abbott government's introduction of number of CVE programs, such as $13.4 million Living Safe Together initiative, had been welcomed but that there were also valuable lessons to be learned from European countries, which had more experience in addressing the current foreign fighter threat.

204,38F5OAUN5PEUDV3U66GO1RR6FGEH7M,26758ed3e0fecca99b6e8287857fa4bfda4bd67d,"(CNN)The news was stunning to hear: A young woman, 18-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide. How could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased, Conrad Roy, 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing? And what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text? But a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe, life-altering legal consequences. That is why Lisa Green, author of the informative new book ""On Your Case: A Compassionate (and Only Slightly Bossy) Legal Guide for Every Stage of a Woman's Life,"" believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case. ""To me this is the unrecognized area that parents, particularly parents of teens, miss all the time,"" said Green during a recent interview at CNN's studios. ""So many of our friends have armies of tutors, extracurricular activities, all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law, there's this black hole."" Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . Green, a journalist, lawyer and television legal analyst, says people often think of the law as scary and intimidating and believe they don't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble. Whether it's a case as serious as Carter's involuntary manslaughter charge, or a simple allegation of vandalism, parents need to be prepared, Green said. ""I cannot count the number of kids I know, good kids, who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said Green. ""I have now two young adults, and when they were going through their teenage years, it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong, a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions, bringing something to school they shouldn't have. ""And in each of those cases, a little bit of knowledge of the law, a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are, the right way to behave, would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief."" Green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone, or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the SAT. Parents' house seized after son's drug bust . ""I am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what's available to you to help you parent better,"" she said. She gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age. For instance, what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts? What parents should know, Green said, is that a school can't open a cell phone for no reason at all. ""They need to have reasonable suspicion that something's wrong,"" said Green, who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials. ""If you're asked, as a child, for a locker search, to open a phone, to open a laptop, if it's your property, pause and ask if you could call Mom and Dad,"" she said. ""We can act whether we're lawyers or not as that first line of defense."" Green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school's code of conduct. ""They don't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say, 'Who can I party with?' But it's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance"" for activities such as drinking on campus, she said. And even before teens head off to college, parents should know about social host laws, where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic. Scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . More than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. In some cases, parents can be held liable even if they didn't know the drinking was taking place. ""It doesn't have to be you with the shaker, like an episode of 'Mad Men,' serving up Manhattans to a group of grateful teens,"" said Green. ""If you've made it possible in your home, if you don't lock your liquor cabinet -- I never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking, that could be a problem as well."" While Green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law, she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home. ""I am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility. If a kid does something wrong, if they broke the law, they ought to be punished appropriately by it. But we also live in a society where we have legal rights, and I want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment."" So if after reading this, you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer, how on earth do you go about finding one? Green's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association, since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues. Then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers, asking them everything from how much their services would cost (that can vary), to who would handle the work, to what their philosophy is about the law and teens' rights. ""You may or may not end up being friends afterwards, but that's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you.""

'And I couldn't quite comprehend what would be going through someone's mind to ask her to take those off.' Lubiewski wrote a post on Facebook about how her daughter 'loves her glasses' and 'needs them to function to the best of her ability,' Yahoo! Parenting reported. 'She is a strong, confident girl and deserves to show off every beautiful part of her, including her glasses.' Lubiewski said that when Abby saw her school photo she asked, 'What happened to my glasses?' But the mother was even more concerned knowing that official school portraits are released to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she told Fox 2 Now. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses.'

'Photographers for school pictures need to be trained on how to capture each unique child,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Even those with disabilities.' Lubiewski said other photographers in the past have been able to work around the glare Abby's thick specs can sometimes cause for the camera. Two pictures of Abby wearing glasses were taken by the photographer, but she wasn't looking at the camera. 'It's not just about getting a cute picture of her,' the mother said. 'It's how she was treated, and how it seems like she was treated differently because there was a part of her that was difficult to photograph.' LifeTouch School Photography has since apologized to the family. 'We should have never had your daughter remove her glasses for the photo,' the company said to the family.

Dana Perino was accompanying the former president as he visited wounded soldiers and their families at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington, D.C. Perino said these regular visits were usually filled with joy, but this particular meeting was one of the exceptions, she wrote in her new book And The Good News Is: Lessons And Advice From The Bright Side. 'The mom was beside herself with grief. She yelled at the president, wanting to know why it was her child and not his who lay in that hospital bed,' Perino wrote in an excerpt published by The Daily Signal.

Perino, who served in the Bush administration for seven years, said the president had been in no hurry to leave the soldier's room as the mother screamed at him. And she said it wasn't until they were both back on the president's Marine One helicopter, heading toward the White House, that Bush addressed the incident. 'That mama sure was mad at me,' Perino recalled the president saying as he looked out the window. 'And I don't blame her a bit.' Perino said she then saw 'one tear' fall from the president's eye and down his face, which he didn't wipe away. On that same day at the hospital, Perino said Bush met a young Marine who opened his eyes for the first time while the president was in the room to award him with a Purple Heart. Perino said the family of the Marine, who had been injured when a roadside bomb hit his Humvee, was 'so excited' to see the president and 'gave him big hugs' as they thanked him 'over and over'. After the Marine was presented with the award by a military aide, Perino said his five-year-old son asked the president what a Purple Heart was. Perino said Bush's regular visits to wounded soldiers and their families at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington D.C. were usually filled with joy, but there were also exceptions (file photo) Perino said Bush 'pulled the little boy closer to him' and said 'it's an award for your dad, because he is very brave and courageous, and because he loves his country so much'. 'And I hope you know how much he loves you and your mom too.' Perino said that's when the medical staff noticed the Marine had suddenly opened his eyes. She said the president 'rushed over to the side of the bed' and took the Marine's face 'in his hands' so they could lock eyes. That's when he asked the military aide to present the Marine with the Purple Heart for a second time, Perino said. 'The president had tears dripping from his eyes on the Marine's face. As the presentation ended, the president rested his forehead on the Marine's for a moment'. She said the scene with the Marine, who she would later find out died six days later from his injuries, brought tears to the eyes of everyone in the hospital room that day 'for so many reasons'. 'The sacrifice, the pain and suffering, the love of country,' she said. 'And the witnessing of a relationship between a soldier and his Commander-in-Chief, that the rest of us could never fully grasp.'

Former Royal chef Darren McGrady said that as children the brothers swapped the instructions from their nanny for their own in which they asked for fast food. William and Harry were apparently fed up with the endless diet of traditional English food so wanted a change. Scroll down for video . Former Royal chef Darren McGrady (right) said that when the Royal princes were children (left) they swapped the instructions from their nanny for their own in which they asked for fast food . William and Harry (pictured as children at Balmoral Castle with the rest of the Royals) were apparently fed up with the endless diet of traditional English food so wanted a change . William and Harry, pictured with their mother, dressed for the start of a new term at school in April 1990 . Mr McGrady said that their 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway. He said that he was 'more scared of the nanny than I was of William' so obeyed her rather than the third in line to the throne. In an interview with People magazine, he said: 'They may be royal children, but they still have children's palettes'. Mr McGrady is the former chef to The Queen and Princess Diana and spent a total of 15 years cooking for them at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace. During that time he got to know the family and their culinary tastes very well. 'I remember holding the boys as babies, when the Princess was eating cereal in the kitchen, thinking, 'Wow, here I am, literally holding the crown jewels,' McGrady he told People. Mr McGrady said the young princes' (pictured with Princess Diana and Prince Charles) 'juvenile handwriting gave their identity away' - and that they ended up with roast chicken anyway . When the Princes (left with Prince Charles on a sking holiday) were growing up the chef of the day at the Palace would send a list of suggestions to the nursery for what they should eat and the nanny (pictured right, with a young William) made her choice and then a butler would bring the meals down to the children . He said that when the Princes were growing up the chef of the day at the Palace would send a list of suggestions to the nursery for what they should eat. The nanny made her choice and then a butler would bring the meals down to the children. William and Harry would eat the same food as adults only it would often be diced or pureed. Mr McGrady said that they were served 'traditional, English food' and William was supposedly fond of cottage pie and peas, poached chicken and rice and fish cakes. He said: 'Everything a normal British child would have. The only difference is that they had a chef cooking it for them.' When it came to dessert they went for 'quintessentially British comfort food' and their favourite was jam roly-poly. He said: 'Each time, I'd send up six pieces, and each of them would go.' Other desserts which were popular with the Princes included summer pudding and sticky toffee pudding which also happens to be a favourite of Princess Kate. Rank played its part even in what the children ate and whenever the Princes were joined by their cousins such as Zara and Peter Phillips or Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, their nanny decided what everyone ate as they were more senior. Mr McGrady said: 'So when William came in, his nanny was the senior nanny, because she had the senior royal, so the boys always had their choice of foods on the menu'.

Once the children attempted to deliver a note to the Royal Chef requesting fast food instead of the traditional English food they were usually served. The Royal Chef noticed straight away the note wasn't from the Royals Nanny and decided to serve there usual meal of roast chicken anyway. As The Royals grew older they would get to pick their meals from a menu with the approval of their nanny.,The royal children were never allowed fast food or the ability to eat out at a restaurant as children. They were only given healthy and traditional English foods that the majority of English subjects would consume such as cottage pies an peas or fish cakes. The only difference between the royals and the public is that their meals were prepared by a chef and usually served by a butler.

The ISIS terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100 others, public health spokesman Najibullah Kamawal said. The claim appears to be the first in Afghanistan by ISIS, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh said. It was made by an offshoot called ISIS Wilayat Khorasan. In a statement, the group said the bomber was named Abu Mohammad and he belonged to their ranks. He was targeting government workers collecting their pay at the bank, the terrorists said. He detonated his charge at the peak of rush hour on the first day of the week, when the bank would be expected to be crowded. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in a text message to journalists, distanced his group from the attack. ""The explosion in Jalalabad doesn't have anything to do with us and we condemn it,"" he said. ISIS refers to Afghanistan and Pakistan as the province of ""Khorasan."" In March, CNN reported on ISIS recruiting in Afghanistan. The United Nations condemned the violence. ""The continuing use of suicide attacks in densely populated areas, that are certain to kill and maim large numbers of Afghan civilians, may amount to a war crime,"" said Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United Nations said that in the first three months of the year 655 people were killed and 1,155 were wounded in suicide attacks throughout the country. Fears about ISIS involvement in the region have been growing this year. In February, Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who had become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan, was killed in a drone strike, according to officials who spoke to CNN. And later that same week, Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was concerned about the growth of ISIS in the area. ""You do have some of the Taliban breaking off and claiming allegiance toward ISIS,"" Campbell said, attributing the phenomenon partly to a feeling of disenfranchisement on the parts of some Taliban members -- who, he said, may use ISIS tactics to gain media attention.

210,3J2UYBXQQNE0YVJTPO4BPLSTYOW60E,201e0b65d71c04c6c61acdc2132f3f2b6e825fe1,"The Obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program. Administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers, urging them to support the deal Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated with Iran, and, at the very least, not to meddle in foreign affairs. The president's spokesman said a two-week break in congressional activity has meant 'that we have not been able to have as many face-to-face conversations as we would like - but that's going to change today.' With the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal, the White House said administration officials would hold classified briefings with Members of Congress aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama sits with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, left, and Energy Secretary Dr. Ernest Moniz at the start the summit with Caribbean Community last Thursday in Kingston, Jamaica. The trio, along with Secretary of State John Kerry and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying Members of Congress and Jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with Iran . OPPOSITION: Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker, pictured here last Friday at the National Rifle Association's annual conference, is whipping support for a bill that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. The White House 'strongly' opposes it . A Senate panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill authored by Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. On the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today that he will bring the bill to the floor if the Senate acts on legislation giving Congress the power to review any deal. 'It's my intention to bring it to the floor of the House and move it,' McCarthy said at a news conference as Congress was returning from its spring break. Republicans and Democrats maintain that Congress should have a say on an international deal with Tehran to curb its nuclear program and have lined up behind legislation. The White House has pushed back, threatening a presidential veto while warning that the bill could scuttle the delicate talks involving the United States, Iran and five world powers. 'Lines in the sands have moved back,' McCarthy said, claiming the U.S. has back-tracked on some of the demands it had at the beginning of the talks. 'A lot of the questions will be why have they moved back and will Iran ever be able to have the capability of having a nuclear weapon? That's a key question.' Under the bill, Obama could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on Iran through presidential executive means. But it would prohibit him for 60 days from suspending, waiving or otherwise easing any sanctions that Congress levied on Iran. During that 60-day period, Congress could hold hearings and approve, disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with Iran. If Congress passed a joint resolution approving a final deal ‚î or took no action ‚î Obama could move ahead to ease sanctions levied by Congress. FIRST STOP: Energy Secretary Moniz, who was a key negotiator in the Iran nuclear deal, speaks to reporters in the White House briefing room last week. This week administration officials, including Moniz, are holding classified briefings with Members of Congress aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months' On the other hand, if Congress passed a joint resolution disapproving it, Obama would be blocked from providing Iran with any relief from congressional sanctions. The White House has said the president will 'absolutely' veto the Corker legislation if it comes to his desk not just because it would allow Congress to thrust itself into the deal-making process but also because it would require Iran to renounce its terrorist activities. Such a requirement would set up an unreasonable expectation that Iran would neither honor nor agree to, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has argued, and could push Tehran to further embrace radical elements. 'The way the legislation is currently written is something that we strongly oppose,' Earnest said today. 'But, again, we continue to have extensive conversations with members of Congress on Capitol Hill.' He later accused members of having their 'priorities backward' and took a shot at House Republicans' ability to whip votes. After a reporter asked him about McCarthy's claim that he is close to achieving a veto-proof majority of support for the bill in the House, Earnest said, 'It's his responsibility to count votes,' then snarked, 'I don't think anybody's battin' 1000 when it comes to countin votes up there.' Secretary of State John Kerry postponed a foreign trip to meet with members of the House to discuss the negotiations. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and senior officials in the intelligence community were also holding classified briefings Monday and Tuesday with members of the House and Senate. Earnest said some Republicans are 'rigidly partisan' and will reject any deal just because President Barack Obama supports it. And while he acknowledged there is some Democratic opposition, administration officials will continue to talk with members of his party, he said. 'I think there are some Democrats who will listen to this pitch,' Earnest said. 'I don't know if it will convince them all, but there is a strong case to make and it's one that we intend to continue making.' On the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today that he will bring the Corker bill to the floor if the Senate acts on legislation giving Congress the power to review any deal . At the White House, Obama today met with Jewish leaders in a separate attempt to woo their support for the shaky deal that appeared last week to be coming apart at the seams as Iranian leaders indicated that they wouldn't sign an accord unless it included the immediate lifting of nuclear-related sanctions -something the global community has said it cannot and will not agree to. Russia has since went rogue, saying it would begin allowing missiles told be sold to the country in an oil-for-goods swap. Secretary Kerry has spoken to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and raised the U.S.' concerns, Earnest told reporters, but declined to provide additional color on their chat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is intensely skeptical that international negotiators can reach a verifiable deal with Iran, which has threatened to destroy Israel, while some American Jewish groups have backed the international negotiations. Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice are meeting with leaders of Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, as well as other 'influencers,' the White House. Put another way, the latter meeting will include major Jewish donors that will be key to the Democratic Party holding the White House beyond January of 2017. The administration will attempt to convince them that the deal under discussion is the best way to protect Israel's sovereignty. Iran says its program is for civilian purposes, but the U.S. and its partners negotiating with Tehran suspect it is keen to become a nuclear-armed powerhouse in the Middle East, where it already holds much sway. The bill giving Congress the power of review has led to a political tug of war on Capitol Hill, with Republicans trying to raise the bar so high that a final deal might be impossible, and Democrats aiming to give the White House more room to negotiate with Tehran. Senators of both parties are considering more than 50 amendments to the measure introduced by Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez of New Jersey.",162,175,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","The Obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that would jeopardize the prospects for negotiating a final deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program.

A father-of-four brutally murdered his wife of 17 years in their kitchen before calmly heading off to work, a court heard. Pharmacist Imran Sharif had dropped the couple's children at their schools before going home and slitting his wife Raheela Imran's throat. Leaving her dead on the kitchen floor, the 'violent and dangerous' 44-year-old changed out of his bloodstained clothes and hid them under the driver's seat of his car. He then stashed the murder weapon - which was never found - and went to work. Paramedics were called to the end-of-terrace home in Hillersdon, Slough on the afternoon of October 20 after Raheela's brother made the gruesome discovery of her body. He had gone round to the house after family members became concerned and found the front door ajar. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck. Sharif was arrested later that day before being charged with murder on October 23. He had originally denied killing his 45-year-old spouse, but later confessed to a friend and fellow prisoner while he was being held in custody at HMP Bullingdon. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Lynch said: 'I am glad that Sharif has accepted responsibility for what he did and admitted that he took his wife's life. 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for Raheela's family and friends as they try to come to terms with their loss and although it may offer them little comfort, I hope that Sharif's guilty plea will be of some help as they begin to rebuild their family's lives.' Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said Raheela's life had been 'brought to a premature end.' Raheela Imran's body was removed from her home in Slough after husband Sharif slit her throat last October . Forensic technologists had investigated at the semi-detached house where Mrs Imran lived with Sharif and their four children . Mr Foster said: 'Having been charged with his wife's murder and while on remand at Bullingdon Prison, Sharif confided in another prisoner, who he had known for about 12 years and admitted killing his wife. 'He is clearly an extremely violent and dangerous man. 'This case represents a tragedy for the family of Raheela. Her children, family and friends have been devastated by her untimely death. 'We have worked closely with Thames Valley Police since this investigation was launched and as a result of the hard work and diligence of the prosecution team, a just outcome has been achieved. A post mortem examination found the mother-of-four died as a result of a wound to the neck . Forensic officers leave the Sharifs' house in Slough where Mrs Imran was found stabbed to death . 'We know that nothing will bring Raheela back to her children, family and friends, but we hope that today's conviction brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done. Our thoughts are very much with them all at this time.' Sharif pleaded guilty to the attack at Reading Crown Court, which happened on October 20 last year in Slough, Berkshire and was remanded for sentencing on May 5. The family were originally from Pakistan but had lived in Slough for 12 years before the tragedy. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said after the murder last year: 'They were great people, it is really shocking.' A resident of neighbouring Bell Close said: 'I walk my dog around past the house and the kids were always outside playing, there were always lots of people running in and out.

Margaret's sister, Ella Thorpe, 70, of Bisbrooke, said: 'Margaret's death was very sudden, she got up at 5am, collapsed and died. It was quite a shock. 'We went in to see Harry and the sister at the hospital, who was marvellous, told him while we sat with him. He took it very badly; he just crumbled when he knew what had happened.

A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly £1million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just £3,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her £1million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent £1,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made £940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud . Abdulhamid was jailed for six years after admitting three counts of conspiracy to defraud, but this year he was ordered to repay just £686 out of the £74,000 profit he made from the scam. During a raid of Oshodi's home, detectives discovered computers with details of more than 11,000 credit cards, including those of almost 8,500 UK customers. In a victim impact statement, Ms Budow said she was 'physically shaking' when she was informed by the bank, adding: 'Since the theft I have been reimbursed the full amount by Santander.

Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, claimed they were surprised to find out that their same-sex wedding plans were featured on Sunday's video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. The pair were seen walking hand in hand in what quickly became one of the most widely viewed political clips of the year. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Scroll down for videos . Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fianc Nate Johnson, who are campaigning Democrats, were featured in Hillary Clinton's video announcing her 2016 White House bid .

'We were both out shopping, working on wedding invitations,' Milrad said of finding out about their new-found fame. He said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. The gay couple were only one in a diverse series of aspirational Americans featured in the Clinton ad, which casts a broad demographic net as she hunts for a winning coalition of voters. The video also featured Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business, a mother seeking to return to the work force, an Asian-American college graduate and expectant African-American parents. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' The vibrant clip, set to snappy music and featuring Clinton for less than half the video's length, is a dramatic departure from Clinton's drab announcement of seven years ago. The video which kicked off her former unsuccessful campaign showed Clinton on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care.

Lynch is expected to take over as head of the U.S. Justice Department on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. The White House said it did not know when exactly Lynch would be sworn in but it wasn't likely to be today. President Barack Obama said in a statement after that the vote that 'America will be better off' having Lynch as its next top cop. 'She will bring to bear her experience as a tough, independent, and well-respected prosecutor on key, bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform,' he said. 'Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law.' Ten . Republicans voted for Lynch, including Senate Majority Leader . Mitch McConnell and expected presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina. Florida's Marco Rubio did not vote in her favor. Cruz tried to block Lynch from clearing a procedural hurdle earlier in the day, giving an impassioned speech on the chamber floor urging his colleagues to oppose her nomination, but was missing when the final tally was taken. 'The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination,' the 2016 Oval Office candidate said said during the debate on whether to take a formal vote on her nomination. 'I would note there are a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority,' he charged. It was not immediately clear why the senator - who had not been shy about his intentions to vote against Lynch - was absent from the floor during the formal vote and a spokeswoman for his 2016 campaign simply told Daily Mail Online that he had a prior commitment in Texas. Like a representative from his Senate office noted on Twitter, the spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said he voted no on cloture, and that's the only one 'that mattered.' 'As you know Sen. Cruz led the charge to oppose her nomination at every turn for the last several months,' she added. Minutes later the Cruz for President invitation began circulating online.

A copy of a Cruz for President invitation that later began flying around Twitter indicates the Texas senator skipped town early to make a fundraiser at the home of former Texas Rangers owner and billionaire Tom Hicks . The voting margin reflected many Republicans' disapproval of . Lynch's support for an executive order issued by Obama in . November that was meant to shield millions of undocumented . immigrants from the threat of deportation. Before the vote, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, an . outspoken critic of that action, blasted Lynch. 'We do not have to confirm someone to the highest law . enforcement position in America if that someone is publicly . committed to denigrating Congress, violating law,' he said. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid berated Republicans for . delaying the confirmation and said Lynch was 'as qualified a . candidate' as he'd seen in almost 30 years in the Senate. Lynch has awaited confirmation since November when Obama, a . fellow Harvard Law School graduate, nominated her. After winning November's midterm elections, Republicans asked the Democratic-led Senate not to shove a vote on Lynch down their throats. In a show of good faith, Democrats acquiesced and let the clock run out on their leadership in the Senate. Her nomination was backed by the Senate's Judiciary Committee by a vote of 12-8 on Feb. 26. But her confirmation languished over an impasse in the Republican-led Senate on an unrelated bill meant to protect human trafficking victims. Democrats had balked at an anti-abortion provision included in that bill, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell put a hold on all business until that issue was resolved. A bipartisan agreement was reached earlier this week, and as a result the process to consider Lynch was allowed to move forward. Hicks is currently in the process of selling his estate, on the market for $98 million as of last month. He is a neighbor of former U.S. President George W.

A 1-0 league victory at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday despite a string of absences was crucial to boost their confidence ahead of the Cup game, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said.

Neuer made a spectacular in injury time from a Marco Reus free kick to ensure the three points . 'The 1-0 victory was a very good sign for us,' Neuer, who made a spectacular save in stoppage time to protect their slim lead, said. 'We have to try to carry this momentum to our game at Leverkusen.' Bayern were without wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as well as David Alaba, who tore a knee ligament and will be out for about two months. They were also missing defender Holger Badstuber, forcing coach Pep Guardiola to overhaul his team and play a new-look midfield with captain Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger.

The addition of the skilled Spain international is undoubtedly a major asset ahead of Leverkusen, who crushed Hamburg SV 4-0 in their league game on Saturday.

Last-ditch effort: Former Virginia first lady (pictured in February) Maureen McDonnell's attorneys argued that her public corruption conviction should be overturned because it was based on an overly broad definition of bribery . Downfall: McDonnell, pictured in February, and her husband, former Gov. Bob McDonnell, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams . Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. Bob McDonnell was sentenced in February to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. Maureen McDonnell's legal team argued that her trial was unfair due a number of mistakes made by the presiding federal district court judge. The lawyers stated in their brief that 'at the very least,' Maureen McDonnell should be granted a new trial. Maureen McDonnell was a onetime Washington Redskins cheerleader who was known for her work with military families. Her father was in the Marines and her husband was in the Army. Bob McDonnell was a former state attorney general who became chairman of the Republican Governors Association and he was widely considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate before the scandal broke. A six-week jury trial exposed details of the McDonnells' strained marriage, and detailed the loans and gifts they took from Williams. 'How can a person become so bedazzled by material possessions that she can no longer see the difference between what's appropriate and inappropriate,' Spencer said. Fighting back tears, Maureen McDonnell apologized to her family and Virginians. Disgraced: Bob McDonnell, pictured outside US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in January, was sentenced in February to two years in prison . Lawyers for both Bob McDonnell and his wife argued in separate briefs that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law . 'I would ask in your sentence today that you consider the punishment I've already received,' she said. 'My marriage is broken, my family is hurting and my reputation is in shatters.' At Bob McDonnell's sentencing, Judge James Spencer described Williams ‚î who testified under immunity for the prosecution ‚î as a 'serpent' that Maureen let into the Executive Mansion. Maureen McDonnell, who according to her lawyer had developed a 'crush' on Williams, said Spencer was right. 'The venom from that snake has poisoned my marriage, has poisoned my family and has poisoned the commonwealth that I love,' she said. 'I opened the door, and I blame no one but myself.' Lawyers for both Bob McDonnell and his wife argued in separate briefs that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. According to Maureen McDonnell's appeal, Judge Spencer gave the jury an overly broad definition of 'official act,' and in what her lawyers described as an 'Orwellian moment,' the prosecution extended it to the governor's wife to prove conspiracy between the spouses, even though she was never a government official, reported the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Her sentence was less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors.

A carer who stole £6,000 from a vulnerable woman and spent some of the money on Girls Aloud concert tickets has been jailed. Lisa Weare, from Blackpool, Lancashire, used the victim's bank card to withdraw money from her account and spent the money on gig tickets, mobile phone bills and textiles for a business she was setting up. The 32-year-old, who spent £500 on four Girls Aloud tickets, has now been jailed for 16 months after a judge told her she had 'let her employers and victim down'. The court heard how Weare was a carer for Fylde Community Link when the crimes took place over an eight-month period between July 2012 and March 2013. Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said the victim was unable to read or write, had no concept of the value of money and needed extensive help for day-to-day living. Part of her care was provided by Weare. He told the court that the victim, who has not been named, had two bank accounts and a locked tin that money would be placed into. There was supposed to be a clear audit trail where any movement of money in or out of the accounts or the tin would be recorded in a cash book and dated. However, one of the victim's three sisters noted small inconsistencies with the movement of the money, which she raised with the company and also at a safeguarding meeting towards the end of 2012. Mr Slack said that in February of the following year a community manager at the company noticed a number of discrepancies regarding the bank accounts. He said money withdrawn had not been recorded in the cash book, or on occasions a lower sum had been entered in the book, compared to the amount actually withdrawn. He said it became clear Weare had been responsible for the bank withdrawals and she was suspended. Further transactions were later discovered. Mr Slack said: 'The defendant bid £500 to buy four Girls Aloud concert tickets. This was in October of 2012. She paid for them in March, three days after she had been suspended. 'Again, the victim's bank card had been used.' Mr Slack added that a textile firm had been paid £175, using the victim's bank card, for 50 metres of organza cloth and there were also payments for mobile phone bills of £929. In total, £6,254 was withdrawn from the bank accounts over the eight-month period, the court heard. Weare admitted theft and three counts of fraud at the hearing today. The judge was told that the victim had been having nightmares about 'horrible things' since the incident and no longer felt safe when she went to sleep. Weare, 32, used some of the money she stole to bid on four concert tickets for pop band Girls Aloud (pictured) Weare was jailed at Preston Crown Court (pictured) for 16 months after admitting theft and three counts of fraud. The court heard she had saved up £3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny . Daniel Harman, defending, said Weare had lost her good character in the most catastrophic way. He said: 'She accrued a large amount of personal debt, run up following difficulties in the marriage and getting in the pocket of pay day lenders. 'Secondly, there was a significant increase in her alcohol intake and catastrophic errors of judgment, where she took from somebody she had worked for over many years.' He added the defendant was remorseful and apologised wholeheartedly. The court heard she had saved up £3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny. Jailing her at Preston Crown Court, Judge Simon Newell told her: 'This case isn't just about £6,000. 'It isn't just about a substantial breach of trust by a young woman who has no previous convictions, but has used this money for her own purposes. 'This is about the distress and devastation of a very vulnerable person. That can't be measured in monetary terms because feelings, emotions and life difficulties are something which are immeasurable.' He told Weare: 'Your employers trusted you, her family trusted you and the woman trusted you. You let all of them down.' Referring to the three examples of where the money went, he said: 'None of honest payments are for basic materials you might need in your life, that someone under stress or financial difficulty might require. 'The victim has had to wait the best part of two years for justice to be done because in that very long period of time there has been avoidance, evasion and denial.'",128,195,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","Lisa Weare, 32, of Blackpool, Lancashire, spent money that did not belong to her over a period of eight months using a stolen bank card. £500 of this was spent on Girl's Aloud tickets. £175 was paid to a textile firm with the victim's bank card and there were mobile phone bills totaling £929.

But while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, secretly she wasn't practising what she preached. As the months ticked by, she piled on the pounds. But desperate to loser weight for the book's photo shoot, she decided to try adopt a novel way to lose weight. Miss Maffucci made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg (24 lbs) in just three months. For every meal, she substituted spiralized vegetables for bread, pasta, rice and potatoes.Here, she tells the Healthista website how she went from a size 14/16 to a size 8/10 so rapidly... Scroll down for video . Ali Maffucci, 28, lost 11 kg (almost two stone) in three months through replacing pasta, bread and rice with spirazlied vegetables. She is pictured before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Now, Ms Maffucci weighs 10 stone, is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight . After eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother, Ali Maffucci fell in love with the spiralizing tool. Not long after, she took to the internet with her blog, Inspiralized, where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables. Then in June of 2013, Ms Maffucci quit her corporate job to become a full time blogger. However while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, she was far from a reflection of that herself. Without the structure of her old job, she gained what she called her 'blogging weight' of 10 kg (22lbs). The spiralizer is a razor-sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables. Originally a Japanese invention, it allows people to create nutritious, very low-calorie, low-carb 'pasta', 'noodles' and 'rice' from everyday fruit and vegetables, in less time than it takes to peel a potato. For example, it can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of 'spaghetti' in a flash. Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you'll apparently get a filling portion of 'rice' with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati. Nutritionists warn it is not a good idea to completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely, as they provide a range of important nutrients. However, many of us are guilty of eating too many carbs, and a spiralizer could help us cut down, said dietitian Vanessa Hattersley. She said: 'Many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta, rice, bread and potatoes when they are on offer. A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein, a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables, so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet.' Being in her apartment all day with her kitchen nearby meant her constant snacking quickly led to weight gain. 'It wasn't necessarily that I was eating unhealthy food, it was more that I was eating a lot of healthy food. 'I was eating a half a tub of almond butter instead of a little bit with an apple slice or the whole tub of hummus,' Ms Maffucci said. 'I was snacking on many healthy things, but eating too many of them.' She describes feeling constantly tired. 'I felt like I was very lazy, even at night time. 'My fianc would come home and I would make dinner for him, and by the time we were done I would be exhausted, and I would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food,' Ms Maffucci said. Later that month, she scored a deal to write a cookbook, which meant she would have to be photographed and featured in it. That's when she knew she had to turn things around. The 'blogging weight' gain had left her at 12 stone and a size 14/16, and she needed to look fit and healthy for the book. 'I told myself, how could I promote this healthy lifestyle if I wasn't living it myself?' She had until late August ‚î about three months ‚î to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot. She made a plan to get to 140-145 pounds (66 kg) - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks. 'I said myself ""I'm gonna eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner, and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled"". 'It's such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you're eating. 'It's healthy and it makes you feel good,' Ms Maffucci said. 'I felt satisfied all the time.' She said didn't find it difficult to stick to spiralized food. 'It is delicious, after all. If you were to boil some pasta, drain it and then try to eat it, it wouldn't really taste good; it's sort of the same thing with spiralized food,' she said. 'What makes the dish delicious is the sauces and the cooking and the other things you put into it.' She said by eating food she normally would, and replacing pasta, rice, potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables, she didn't have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health. Ms Maffucci said she didn't find it difficult to stick to spiralized food (her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured). She said: 'It's such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you're eating' Ms Maffucci wrote a book, Inspiralized: Inspiring Recipes to Make With Your Spiralizer, following her weight loss . 'I always tell people, you won't notice a big change in your flavor profile but you'll notice it in the way you feel afterwards and how full you feel, and you feel a lot lighter,' she said. She even mastered how to incorporate weekend indulgences into her diet. 'I think of all of the foods that I love to eat that aren't good for me and I literally sit and brainstorm and say how can I make this inspiralized?' she said. Her recipe for Blueberry Sweet Potato Waffles was one she came up with when she had a craving one hungover Sunday morning. After sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule, Ms Maffucci reached 150 pounds (68 kg) by early August, extremely close to her goal. Now she rests at ten stone, size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight. Compared to her old lifestyle, she said she is much happier, focused and energised. 'After I lost the weight, I would do something as little as writing a thank you note that before I would push off because I was so exhausted. 'I would clean out my drawers at night instead of sitting on the couch and watching TV. 'My focus during the days was so much stronger too. Without that old laziness anymore I get so much more done now.' Visit Ms Maffucci's blog, Inspiralized, for recipes and tips. Her book is available on Amazon.

Titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine, the movie ‚ about a female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops ‚ is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived. And despite the freeze in ties between the former Soviet nations that has seen Ukraine ban a slew of modern Russian films, the $5million (£3m) movie was launched last week with glitzy gala premieres in both Moscow and Kiev. Scroll down for video . Nazi killer: A Russian-Ukrainian film about legendary Soviet sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko (left) who was nicknamed nicknamed 'Lady Death' is aiming to be a hit in both nations despite the current crisis. The film (right) is titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine . Will it bring unity? The movie ‚ about the female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops ‚ is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived . Director Sergei Mokritsky, who grew up in Ukraine but lives in Russia, told AFP: 'Despite everything, it has been accepted both by the new Ukrainian authorities and our Russian ones. 'I am hoping this film will unite people and at least for two hours, for the length of this film, people can come together in our shared history.' The Russian-language film is about Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko ‚ nicknamed 'Lady Death' ‚ and comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two. Trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941, aged 25, Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Hard-hitting biopic: Russian actors Yevgeny Tsyganov (left) and Yulia Peresild (right), who plays Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko are seen in a still from Sergei Mokritsky's 'Battle of Sevastopol' film . Bringing together a shared history: The Russian-language film (above) comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two . Heroine: Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula during World War Two . Lyudmila Pavlichenko was sent to the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 after being trained as a sniper. An unyielding character, she is said to have killed no fewer than 309 Nazis during the sieges of Odessa and later the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. It is said she once lambasted a fellow sniper for firing a shot than ended the agony of a dying Nazi, saying: 'They don't deserve an easy death.' She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she is evacuated from Sevastopol after getting injured, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union then sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. The new biopic was shot on location in Sevastopol in November and December 2013 during the Maidan popular uprising in Kiev, shortly before the toppling of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's annexation of Crimea. 'I thought we can't stop filming, whatever happens,' Mokritsky recalled. 'The faster, the better, because later, it may not be possible.' The differing titles for the film highlight some of the bitterest divisions between Russia and Ukraine. In Russian, the title 'Battle for Sevastopol' resonates with the patriotic fervour generated by Crimea's annexation in March last year. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian name 'Indestructible' hints at the national spirit as government forces battle a pro-Russian uprising in the country's east. As played by Yulia Peresild, the film's heroine is unsmiling and unremittingly tough. 'War's no place for cowards,' she says. She vows to ""kill 100 enemies"", hugging her rifle and upbraids a fellow sniper for firing a shot to finish off a Nazi dying in agony. ""They don't deserve an easy death,"" she says. In graphic battle scenes with blood spurting and shells exploding, she shoots to kill without flinching. But she has a softer side, too. She finds love in the arms of a tough commander, who is killed soon afterwards. She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she gets injured and is evacuated from Sevastopol, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. The next stage in Pavlichenko's life is far from the horrors of the frontline. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. Pavlichenko was trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 . She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. In the film, she reveals her emotional turmoil while cooking borscht with a motherly Roosevelt, played by British actress Joan Blackham. The film comes hot on the heels of the global smash directed by Clint Eastwood about a U.S. Navy Seal sharpshooter 'American Sniper'. Critics have lauded the vivid photography in the Ukrainian-Russian film, but complain that Pavlichenko does not come across as a fully-rounded character. 'She faces all these events with the same tense expression,' wrote Gazeta.ru news site. As for the two governments now locked in a bitter feud, both say they are rooting for the film to be a success - just not quite for the same reasons. 'We see it as a Ukrainian film,' a spokesman for Kiev's state film agency told AFP, saying that 79 percent of the film's financing is Ukrainian, both from the state and private investors. Meanwhile in Russia, an unusually conciliatory Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said he hoped the movie might remind the rivals of when they fought side by side. 'It's very important today that it's a Ukrainian-Russian co-production. This is a film about our shared victory,' Medinsky said. SIEGE OF ODESSA: . The Ukrainian city of Odessa was subjected to an unrelenting aerial bombardment by the Nazis and their Axis allies in June 1941. Surrounded on three sides, it was anticipated that Soviet forces would succumb quickly, but a channel via the Black Sea allowed for supplies and reinforcements to make their way into the city. A second onslaught began in mid-August, but was forced to halt around a week later for a few days because of heavy casualties at the hands of the Red Army.

However, by September 15, Soviet troops began to fall back towards the city and by early October, Moscow ordered a retreat. In the first two weeks of October, more than 120,000 troops were evacuated, along with 1,000 trucks and 20,000 tons of ammunition. On October 15, Romanian troops ‚ part of the Axis alliance ‚ entered the city. The Romanians lost nearly 18,000 troops while the Soviet Union lost around 16,000. Source: World War II Database . BATTLE FOR SEVASTOPOL: . Sevastopol, a key port city on the Black Sea, came under attack from five Nazis divisions, supported by Luftwaffe bombardments, in May 1942. Soviet troops were battered by up to 1,800 aerial sorties a day and were outnumbered by two to one on the ground. The Soviet Coastal Army, led by General I.E. Petrov, mustered 106,000 men, 600 artillery guns, 100 mortars and 38 tanks. German sappers at Sevastopol, where a massive siege was launched against the Soviet Red Army . The Germans, meanwhile, assembled 204,000 men, 670 artillery guns, 720 mortars, 655 anti-tank guns, 450 tanks and 600 aircraft. By the end of June, the Germans fought their way into the city and an evacuation of Russian forces in the city was ordered on June 30, lasting for four days. By the end of the siege, 90,000 Russian prisoners had been taken and they lost the equivalent of two armies.

Nadine Crooks, 33, who lives in Smethwick, West Midlands, was stunned to discover she was expecting again as doctors told her she was infertile after she had her fourth child. She stopped taking contraceptives after learning she had polycystic ovary syndrome following the birth of her son Joshua 18 months ago. Set to become seven siblings: Nadine Crooks who is expecting triplets pictured with her four children, from left, Trae (13), Roxanne (18), Zion (9) and Joshua (1) The 33-year-old was stunned to fall pregnant again after being told she was infertile . Doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally again after cysts were found on both her swollen ovaries. She stopped taking the Pill and was stunned when she fell pregnant for a fifth time last November. She said: 'I was shocked when I found out I was pregnant. When they told me I was going to have three, I couldn't believe it at all. 'They had told me I had polycystic ovaries shortly after Joshua was born. 'I decided to stop taking contraceptives and thought that was that. I was content with my four children so the idea of almost doubling my family has taken some getting used to.' Nadine was told polycystic ovary syndrome would prevent her becoming pregnant again following the birth of her fourth child, Joshua, pictured . Nadine has been told she is now expecting two boys and a girl with her 35-year-old partner, who did not want to be named. The triplets will be siblings to Roxanne, 18, Trae, 13, and Zion, nine, and Joshua, 18 months. The mother, who was born in Jamaica, said: 'I thought I was finished with babies. It is incredible.' She found out she was expecting triplets, who are due in July, at her 12-week scan at Birmingham Women's Hospital. 'I'm thrilled about it now but at the time I thought it must be some kind of joke. I knew I was pregnant though because I obviously know the signs by now,' Nadine said. 'I have no history of twins or triplets in my family and neither does my partner but we feel blessed to be having more children.' Nadine with her four children said they are all amazed that she's set to have three more . Her unplanned pregnancy meant she had to give up a college course in hairdressing so she can remain a full-time mother. 'I had planned to go to college but then I found I was pregnant. I wanted to further my career. I had been a hairdresser for some time but wanted to take the hairdressing course at college. 'So it has had an effect on my career. I really wanted to carry on working but had to stop,' she explained. The mother-of-four admits her whole family were amazed when she announced she would be adding another three to her brood. The expectant mother had been due to start a course in hairdressing but her career plans are now on hold . Nadine's scans, pictured left and right, have revealed she is expecting two boys and a girl due in July . She said: 'My family were shocked but I am only coming to terms with it now myself. My mum was not very happy. She thought four children was enough. 'When their father found out, he put his head in hands. He was quite shocked. 'I used to watch these programmes on TV about people with triplets and quadruplets and think I couldn't cope with that but I've got lots of family to help me when they arrive.'

The auction house is offering an untitled work by Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are English -- every defeat suffered by the England team between 1874 and 1998. Cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large (and it would have to be, wouldn't it?) piece of black granite, meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings. The artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply: ""I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death."" Known for his humorous and satirical art, Cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to Scotland in Glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against Romania at the 1998 World Cup. Since then, of course, he'd have had a fair few more to immortalize, including the two to Italy and Uruguay in Brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever England display at a World Cup. The artist, whose other works include La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in London in 1999. It's not known whether any England managers and players, past or present, came along to have a sneaky look. Current England boss Roy Hodgson is known to be a bit of an Italophile, but the former Inter Milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- Cattelan's work is on public exhibition at Sotheby's New Bond Street galleries until Tuesday 10 March. It will then be offered as part of the single-owner 'Bear Witness' sale.",217,205,"club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","art, museum, display, century, history, ancient, modern, painting, original, library,","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","art museum, ancient art versus modern art, exhibit on art history, an original painting, history section of the library","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.","This topic is about exhibitions on art history, showing original paintings in an art museum, as well as the history section of the library about ancient art versus modern art.","A sculptor has build a momument that is currently being sold for 900,000 dollars that has every loss of the English National Football team from 1874-1998.

Its FireChat app paved the way for chatting to friends without the need for the web or even a mobile signal. And now developers at Open Garden have built Greenstone - a small egg-shaped gadget that acts like a beacon, or a booster, to help messages move around so-called wireless mesh networks more easily . FireChat launched last year and has been downloaded more than five million times. It takes advantage of a feature that launched in Apple's iOS 7 called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF). Android has a similar feature that works over Bluetooth. MCF lets you send messages and photos even when a person has no signal by creating what is called a wireless mesh network. Apple added to Multipeer Connectivity framework (MCF) to iOS 7. It creates what's called a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other. Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, the features lets users send messages to people in close proximity that are in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct range - up to around 30 feet (9 metres). It does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node and the data is passed between nodes. Apple uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - and Greenstone has been designed to solve this. When a user opens the FireChat app, they pick a screen name to start sending messages. Within the app there are 'chatrooms' with 'Everyone' and 'Nearby' options. The former will search for all users, while the latter option applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range who are also using the app. This is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground. It can also be used to save money on data plans, for example. The app creates a localised network in which each phone becomes a node, and the data is passed between nodes. Apple . uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it . easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. These messages are sent securely, so the individual nodes can't read them. Users can also send messages anonymously to avoid snooping, for example, because data is sent from app usernames, as opposed to mobile numbers. Elsewhere, because the feature doesn't use an internet connection, it can't be infiltrated by hackers. The 'Everyone' Setting allows people to send information further, however. It does this by bringing all its nodes . onto one network and relaying messages from one node to another until . it reaches the final recipient. In FireChat (left) there are 'chatrooms' called Everyone and Nearby. The former searches for all users, while the latter applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range. It takes advantage of a tool used by Apple for AirDrop (right). This creates a network in which phones become nodes, and data is passed between nodes . Nodes . are simply a vehicle for passing data along a network. On a traditional . internet network any device that's connected to the network is also . called a node. FireChat (pictured) has been downloaded more than five million times and is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground . For example, if a network has a phone, tablet, two computers and a printer connected to it there are five nodes on the network. Each . of these devices has a network address which is used to uniquely . identify each one. This helps keep track of where data is being . transferred to and from on the network. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - and Greenstone has been designed to plus these gaps. Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden told Daily Dot: 'The combination between [Greenstone] and the smartphones will enable a community, or a neighbourhood, or a hospital, or any other situation where they want resilient communication, even in the case of not having any connectivity.' It could also be placed in certain locations at music festivals, organised protests, football matches and other events where having large numbers of people can crash networks. Greenstone is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20ft (6 metres). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life. It can additionally hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone and the timeframe will depend on these partnerships.",144,245,"online, users, internet, site, device, people, computer, iphone, data, devices,","facebook, mobile, phone, network, samsung, screen, apps, smart, ad, watch,","online internet users, people check websites on different devices, using an iPhone App to surf the internet, computer devices, data plans","mobile phone, Facebook app, social network, smart watch, Samsung phone screen, apps containing ads, watching ads","This topic is about online internet users, using an iPhone app to surf the internet, computer devices, data plans, and people checking a website on different devices.","This topic is about mobile phones and social networking such as the Facebook app, smart watches, as well as apps containing ads that can be watched on phone screens like Samsung.","FireChat app has enabled online internet users to chat online without a need for or the web or even a mobile signal.

Opening ceremonies in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kick off Saturday in Anchorage. When the race begins Monday, mushers will cross the starting line in Fairbanks instead of Willow, the traditional starting point. It's the second time in the race's 43-year history that the starting point has moved from Willow to Fairbanks because of weather-related issues, an Iditarod spokesperson said. The first time was in 2003. While cities across the northeastern United States have seen record snowfall this winter, Alaska received less snow than usual. Anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season, compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches. Race organizers made the unanimous decision in February to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas, and ""therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race,"" Iditarod Chief Executive Stan Hooley said in a press release. While snow has fallen east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it, Hooley told CNN affiliate KTVA-TV in February. The racing course spans a 1,000-mile trail across the Arctic tundra, ending in Nome. The race usually takes 10 days to finish, although Dallas Seavey finished the race in 2014 in a record time of eight days, 13 hours, four seconds, and 19 minutes. The lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the Pacific to the region, said meteorologist Dave Snider with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. ""It's the same weather pattern that brought the east coast such snowy and cold weather this season. Alaska was simply on the warmer side of this weather pattern,"" he said. Warm sea surface temperatures along the Alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions, he added.",218,101,"snow, weather, cold, winter, temperatures, conditions, hot, morning, expected, parts,","crown, grand, race, hamilton, team, track, formula, collision, ferrari, adelaide,","winter temperatures, hot weather conditions, a cold morning, snow is expected later","formula 1 race, ferrari team, collision during the race, hamilton's team, grand prix, race track","This topic is about winter temperatures as opposed to hot weather conditions, cold mornings, and weather forecasts like snow being expected later.","This topic is about Formula 1 racing, the Grand Prix on the race track, Hamilton‚Äôs team and the Ferrari team, and collisions during a race.",Alaska has seen an unseasonably warm winter.

231,37FMASSAYETHB2H4P5AP65EHXM3IBQ,715c75873942eac603a689d5e1fe896e11ad4fdc,"Liverpool are the biggest English club when measured solely by the number of major trophies won, all-time. With 18 league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, five European Cups and three UEFA Cups, they have lifted 41 major honours in their history, two more than their closest rivals in this regard, Manchester United, who have 39. United have more league titles, 20, and 13 of those have been won since Liverpool's last league title in 1989-90. They also have more FA Cup wins than Liverpool (11), but fewer League Cups (four), fewer European Cups (three) and fewer other European trophies (one, the Cup-Winners Cup of 1990-91). The silverware has been totted up as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the 'biggest'; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered, having played in England's top division for at least a season. John Barnes and Peter Beardsley celebrate in 1990 with the last league trophy to head to Liverpool . Steven Gerrard hoists Old Big Ears aloft after that famous night in Istanbul . Crowds . We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs. Global fanbase . We added up the total number of fans and followers for each club on Facebook and Twitter ‚î by far the most popular global social media platforms. Every club has official accounts. Trophies . We counted 'major' trophies won by each club, giving points for each; 10pts for each European Cup/Champions League win, 8pts for each top-division English title, 5pts for each FA Cup or other European trophy win, and 3pts for each League Cup win. No 'one-off' trophies such as the Charity Shield are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions. And being a losing finalist does not count for points either ‚î here at Sportsmail, winning is everything, second is nowhere. Average league finish . The average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888-89. Player quality . We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic 'bigness'. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup ‚î a measure of modern 'bigness'. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. Income . We ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available. The biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players. The trophies considered as 'major' are those earned through playing a whole season, tournament or competition, so no 'one-off match' silverware has been included, such as the Charity Shield or Super Cup, nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been 'one-off match' occasions - like the Intercontinental Cup, which morphed into the Club World Cup. Some trophies are bigger than others; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an FA Cup, or that a European Cup is bigger than a League Cup. So we have weighted the trophies, awarding 10 points for each European Cup, eight for each league title, five for an FA Cup or other European trophy and three for each League Cup win. In fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting, the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied. Liverpool stay at No1 for example ahead of United, themselves clear of Arsenal (28 trophies) in third, Aston Villa (20) in fourth and Chelsea (also 20) in fifth. When clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them. Villa and Chelsea have both won a European Cup but Villa's seven league titles to Chelsea's four made the difference between that pair. When the points are the same, the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher. The full rankings of the 'biggest' clubs by trophies accompany this piece. Of the 59 teams in our study, 46 of them have won at least one major trophy. The 12 that haven't are ranked by how closely they have come, for example as runners-up in the FA Cup (which is as close as Crystal Palace, Fulham and Hull among others have come), runners-up in the League Cup (Oldham) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division. After the top five trophy winners come Everton and Tottenham in sixth and seventh places, Everton ahead on points because their nine league titles, the last of them in 1986-87, are far superior to Tottenham's two titles, the second and last in 1960-61. Spurs are more cup specialists, having won eight FA Cups, four League Cups and three cups in Europe, albeit not the European Cup. Manchester City, Newcastle and Sunderland fill out the top 10 places, with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former Premier League teams, among them Blackburn, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds, Huddersfield, Sheffield United, Portsmouth and Preston among them, all of who have won the English title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories. Bolton in 23rd place are the highest-ranked club never to have won the title, and are 23rd courtesy of their four FA Cup wins. They are a place above West Ham, who have also never won the title and have won three FA Cups. Arsene Wenger and Tony Adams beam after Arsenal won the Double in 2002 .

The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. ""This is a problem that is off the charts historically,"" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. ""Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries."" He concluded, ""We're in unchartered territory here."" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. ""We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,"" he said. ""Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do."" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. ""We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,"" McGurk said. ""They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,"" he acknowledged. ""But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani."" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: ""The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.""",64,162,"group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","around 20,000 militants from various nations have perpetrated Syria.

'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.'

Tianwen Chen, 65, and his wife Gairen Guo, 60, found their first child in a box on the roadside and gradually took more and more disabled children into their two-bedroom home in rural Shanxi province, central China. But the couple have faced a great deal of heartache over the years, and are only now living comfortably with 12 of the children with the help of donations by kind-hearted people, according to the People's Daily Online. Big family: Tianwen Chen and his wife Gairen Guo have adopted 40 disabled children over the past 26 years. Nine of the children can be seen here, enjoying a family meal together . Working hard: The Chens can now afford to send their children to school, but it hasn't always been this way . The couple, who live outside of Yuanping city, found their first child - a baby girl - on the side of the road one day in 1989 and carried her home, despite not having much to live on themselves. Tianwen said he immediately felt an emotional connection with the child: 'This baby girl was in a cardboard box. She was so tiny and skinny. Both of her legs were weird and you could tell at first glance that she was disabled.' 'When I saw this baby girl, I felt like I had been through the same things.' Difficult life: All of the children were disabled and many had been abandoned by their biological parents . Devoted: Tianwen says he was desperate to help and began to take more and more children into their home . Ever-growing: The couple said that even the local authorities began sending children to their home . He suffers from a genetic eye condition, and says that this made him desperately want to help disabled children. Eventually, nearly 20 children were sleeping on the floor in their 20 square metre farmhouse. The couple themselves had barely any space to lie down. They would take it in turn to wake up three or four times every night to feed the babies and change their nappies. The couple did not even have a washing machine, and Gairen was forced her laundry in icy water that was often -20 degrees Celsius. Even the local authorities began to send disabled children to the Chens, but unfortunately the government subsidy for foster parents only covered the cost of milk powder. The couple gradually used up all their savings, making them fear for the future of their children. Caring: Tianwen, feeding one of the babies above, found a baby girl in a box on the side of the road . Grief: Sadly nine of the children died. The parents still visit their tombs to carry out religious rituals . The children needed constant medical treatment, which became extremely expensive. The couple went with various children to the doctor twice a week and every day during flu season. The healthiest child had a cleft lip and palate. Sadly, nine of the children died and another 12 were adopted by other families. None of their neighbours were willing to help and it became too much for the eldest son - who decided to get up and leave. But a short online film telling the story of the Chens has changed their lives forever. The documentary called 'Fading flowers' gained a huge amount of support and nearly £14,000 was raised to buy the family a new 500 square metre home. The children have also been able to receive proper medical treatment, and five of them have had their disabilities corrected. Today, the couple have 12 children living with them - the eldest is 16, and the youngest is 6. Gairen said it's all been worth it: 'As long as we live, we will care for the children.' Happier times: 12 children still live with the couple and can now receive proper treatment due to generous donations from the public . New home: A short film telling the family's story received tremendous support online, raising £14,000 . Good education: The couple still hope to send the children to school in the city .",200,115,"children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","A farming couple has devoted their lives to adopting disabled orphans - taking in more than 40 children over the last 26 years.

In its ruling on Tuesday evening, the all-Republican court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning same-sex marriage violates the US Constitution does not prevent it from following state law. In Alabama, marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries, it said, siding with an argument recently offered by a pair of conservative organizations. 'Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty', the court added. Ruling: The Supreme Court of Alabama (pictured) has ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in the latest development in a fierce battle over the power of federal law . The state's probate judges now have five days to file a letter stating why they should not have to adhere to the court's decision, according to ABC. Six justices concurred in Tuesday's 134-page opinion, which was not signed. However, the court's most outspoken opponent of gay marriage, Chief Justice Roy Moore, recused himself. Last month, two conservative groups appealed a decision by District Judge Callie Granade of Mobile, who ruled that Alabama's constitutional and statutory bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. Immediately after Granade's ruling, Moore told probate judges across the state they were not obliged to issue same-sex marriage licenses. His stance created widespread confusion among judges. Awaiting a license: In its ruling on Tuesday evening, the court said a previous federal ruling stating that banning gay marriage violates the US Constitution does not prevent it from following state law. Above, Shante Wolfe, left, and Tori Sisson, right, wait for their marriage license to be processed in Montgomery, Ala., last month . Protesters: In Alabama, marriage has been legally defined as the union of only one man and one woman for two centuries, the court said. Above, people rally against same-sex marriage in Montgomery on February 21 . Some refused to issue the licenses to engaged same-sex couples, while others shut down their operations for all couples, gay and straight, until they could get a clear answer. Justice Jim Main agreed with the result but said he has concerns about procedural aspects 'of this highly unusual case'. In a dissent, Justice Greg Shaw said it was 'unfortunate' that federal courts refused to delay gay marriage in the state until the US Supreme Court could settle the issue nationally. But, Shaw said, the state Supreme Court does not have the power to consider the issue. The court released the decision while Gov. Robert Bentley and most state leaders were assembled in Montgomery for the state of the state address. Differing opinions: Six justices concurred in Tuesday's opinion, which was not signed. However, the court's most outspoken opponent of gay marriage, Chief Justice Roy Moore (left), recused himself. Right, Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the court's position was 'unfortunate' Bentley's spokesman said the administration was reviewing the decision and had no comment. Joe Godfrey, executive director of the Alabama Citizens Action Program, said he was 'very excited' about the decision blocking judges from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. 'We are concerned about the family and the danger that same-sex marriage will have. It will be a devastating blow to the family, which is already struggling,' Godfrey said. He added the ruling will give 'some stability' in Alabama until the Supreme Court rules later this year. However, lawyers representing same-sex couples seeking the right to marry in Alabama said the court showed 'callous disregard' in its decision. It added that the court overstepped its bounds by declaring that Alabama's ban on same-sex marriages is constitutional, something the justices had not been asked to consider. 'It is deeply unfortunate that even as nationwide marriage equality is on the horizon, the Alabama Supreme Court is determined to be on the wrong side of history,' said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The court's decision Tuesday came in response to a request from the Alabama Policy Institute and the Baptist-run Alabama Citizens Action Program to halt same-sex unions after Granade's ruling.

The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations. He holds little appeal to Latino voters. And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate ""Gang of 8"" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates. That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.  He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended. He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a ""horrifying precedent."" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics. No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, ""We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally."" So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against ""one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday."" But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past. Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States. Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice. Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans. By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics. He is a fierce opponent of ""Obamacare"" and wants the law repealed. However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law. (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for ""Obamacare"" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less. And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic. But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate. In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals. Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana. Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand. By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership. Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.",113,175,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.",Marco Rubio a Republican Senator from Florida is going to run for President.

""We canceled two roundtrip flights between Anchorage and Bethel, and Anchorage and Nome after an advisory of low visibility,"" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Halley Knigge said. Ash from Russia's Shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions Saturday, said Jeff Freymueller, a scientist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The volcano erupted Friday, shooting ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet. Winds blew the ash cloud across the Bering Sea and into western Alaska, Freymueller said. Shiveluch, which has been erupting consistently, caused a similar incident in January, he said. The airline will only operate flights when it's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash.

Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter urged the defendants during the sentencing hearing on Monday to accept deals with the prosecution in the trial over a widespread conspiracy to cheat on state tests. He also threatened prison sentences for them if they fail to reach those deals. 'I've got a fair sentence in my mind and it involves going to jail for everybody,' said Baxter. He also said, 'I don't think you want to go my way. Either it's my way or a negotiated plea.' The sentencing will resume on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter presides over the sentencing of 10 of the 11 defendants convicted of racketeering and other charges in the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating trial in court on Monday . Former Atlanta public school educators fill the courtroom during the sentencing hearing which began on Monday . Former Atlanta public school Dunbar Elementary teacher Pamela Cleveland reacts in court as she listens to her mother testify on her behalf during witness statements during the sentencing . Reverend Bernice King (left), daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young were both present in court on Monday . If the convicted educators accept deals, they would be required to apologize and waive their right to appeal, and former administrators would be given punishments from one year of weekend jail time and a $10,000 fine, according to the AJC. Former teachers and testing coordinators would be given one year of home confinement and a $1,000 fine. During a trial lasting nearly six months, prosecutors accused the defendants of erasing incorrect answers or instructing students to change their answers so the educators could secure promotions and cash bonuses in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system in 2009. The educators fed answers to students or erased and changed the answers on tests after they were turned in to secure promotions or up to $5,000 each in bonuses. However, the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A total of 35 Atlanta educators were indicted in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft. Many pleaded guilty before the trial, and some of them testified at the months-long trial. The jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who had been on trial and convicted the other 11 on a racketeering charge, and were facing up to 20 years in prison. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses. On Monday during the sentencing, Baxter said any children who were promoted based on false test scores were the real victims, adding that can lead to students later dropping out of school because they cannot do the work, having been cheated out of the earlier education. Such children often end up in trouble with the law, he said. 'They are the most vulnerable children in our city, and they were short-changed,' Baxter said. 'They were passed on and now they're in the prison system.' Baxter heard from character witnesses for 10 of the 11 defendants convicted this month of racketeering for their roles in a scheme to inflate students' scores on standardized exams. The witnesses ‚î mostly friends and relatives of the defendants ‚î pleaded for mercy and described the former educators' passion for teaching and dedication to their students, which often extended to devoting their personal time and money to help.

Former Atlanta Public School Dobbs Elementary principal Dana Evans asks for leniency during sentencing of racketeering charges in one of the largest U.S. test-cheating scandals during the sentencing . The 11th former educator who was convicted was pregnant when the jury reached its verdict and gave birth over the weekend. She is set to be sentenced later. Baxter listened carefully, often asking questions, and said repeatedly that while he didn't doubt the former educators' commitment and teaching ability, he believed they had made bad decisions. Whenever a witness or defense attorney questioned the jury's verdict, the judge quickly made it clear that he had heard the evidence and agreed with the verdict. Baxter said he arrived at work Monday with what he believed to be a fair sentence in mind. However, District Attorney Paul Howard told him he had been speaking with defense attorneys over the weekend and that he believed the case could be resolved with negotiated pleas, eliminating the possibility of appeals that could stretch on for years. 'I just see all the pain in this room,' Baxter said. 'It's a tragedy for all of you ‚î the defendants, your families, your friends.' The only reason he would send them to jail, he said, would be for retribution. Fulton County Senior Asst. DA Clint Rucker talks with another member of the prosecution team during witness statements for the defendants . Former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young testifies during witness statements at the sentencing asking the judge for leniency arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison . 'I just think the best thing for our community in this whole sordid mess is for Paul Howard to talk to each of you and enter pleas,' Baxter said before calling a late lunch break around 2pm. When the hearing resumed an hour later, Baxter said the court would recess until Tuesday morning to give defense attorneys time to discuss with the district attorney about possible deals. Howard said he wants to see the defendants accept responsibility. Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, last week urged the judge to spare the 11 educators from prison. Former elementary school principal Dana Evans was one of only two former educators who addressed the judge herself on Monday. She apologized and appealed to his sense of compassion, and Baxter made it clear he had sympathy for her, saying, 'you were under so much pressure, so my heart goes out to you.' In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . Superintendent Beverly L. Hall was the alleged ringleader of the cheating scandal, but denied any involvement. She died of breast cancer last month . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in . One principal wore gloves as she erased and changed the answers . Nearly 180 employees, including 38 principals, were accused of wrongdoing . The report said Superintendent Beverly L. Hall (right) had 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' that had permitted 'cheating ‚î at all levels ‚î to go unchecked for years' The cheating allowed educators to collect bonuses and improve the ailing reputation of the Atlanta school system, the investigation found . It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 . In March 2013, Dr Hall and 34 educators were indicted by a grand jury on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft . 21 of the educators plead guilty to reach plea agreements . They received between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service and must repay their bonuses . 12 educators chose to stand trial . The trail started in August 2014 . Dr Hall did not stand trial or accept a plea, claiming she was too sick . She died of breast cancer in March 2015 . Prosecutors said the 12 were looking out for themselves rather than their students . On Wednesday, only one of the 12 educators were acquitted . The 11 educators - teachers, a principal and other administrators - were found guilty . The racketeering charges carry up to 20 years in prison . Source: AP, The New York Times . 'I know you want to hear an admission of guilt, but I can't do that because it's not true,' Evans told the judge, but added that she could say she is sorry. One defense attorney called former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador Andrew Young to testify. Young said he had no connection to any of the defendants, but that his family includes many teachers. 'We have messed up education so much. Tests and grades do not make you educated,' he said on Monday, later adding, 'I think these teachers got caught in a trap.' Young asked Baxter for leniency, saying educators are 'the backbone of this society' and arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. On Monday, Larry Pratt (above holding a memorial program for former superintendent Beverly Hall) protesters stood outside of the Fulton County courthouse with others during a protest to free the 11 educators . Protesters chant outside the Fulton County courthouse on Monday during the sentencing hearing of the convicted former educators . According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable.

A married mother of two battling cancer has been ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.'

The soldiers have recently been taking part in the Atlantic Resolve exercise, which was intended to demonstrate NATO's readiness to defend its members. Poland borders Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between the two countries has caused anxiety there. Putin, in particular, is seen as the main driving force behind the war, allegedly sending Russian troops to support the rebels in the east who want independence from the Ukrainian government. In just a year, it has cost more than 5,600 lives - and Russia's neighbours have become increasingly concerned Putin will turn his attention to them next. Lithuania, for example, feels the threat from Moscow feels is so real the government plans to reintroduce military conscription. But so far, America and the rest of Europe have refused to show any sort of military might towards the former Soviet Union - while Putin has made sure the rest of the world is in no doubt of the strength of his armed forces. Just this week, Putin boasted of a massive military exercise across his country, involving 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft, marking the beginning of a series of such drills this year. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin Tuesday that the manoeuvres were aimed at checking the readiness of the newly formed group of forces in the Arctic, as well as the military's capability to quickly field troops to several theatres of operations.

It was all very cheesy, but he's so good looking that I gave him my number.' Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. ""My love, where are you?"" he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her.

'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.'

Premier League director of communications Dan Johnson said the clubs' decision two years ago to introduce spending controls had also contributed to a positive financial outlook . Johnson said: 'There are two reasons for this. The first is increasing revenues and the second is the financial criteria the clubs have voted in two seasons ago which put financial sustainability at the heart of how they want to go forward.'

When iD launches next month it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17. Carphone Warehouse's iD will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer these networks and plans. 'Carphone Warehouse is unique because we speak to more customers across the networks than anyone else. This gives us a unique customer insight,' UK and Ireland chief executive Graham Stapleton told MailOnline. The iD network (logo pictured) will use Three's existing infrastructure to offer networks and plans . 'They tell us what could be better across the whole of the industry and iD is based on that insight; giving customers what they want. 'We're building this network from scratch and are using the latest technology to connect and build iD, and because tech is moving so quickly we've been able to come up with something innovative and different.' He said that at launch Carphone Warehouse is creating a platform for the network and in 'two to three months' time [it] will launch products that no-one else will have.' But Mr Stapleton wouldn't reveal what these will be in order to maintain a competitor advantage over rival networks. He continued that the aim is to have all the handsets it currently sells available on the network. 'The reason we are putting 12-month contracts and deals out there is that there is no-one else offering such 12 month contracts and our customers said it was a feature they wanted,' he continued. iD won't the only network to offer 12-month contracts, though. Vodafone, for example, has a range of contracts that start at £9.50 a month. When iD launches it will offer the most comprehensive range of roaming countries, shown in the graph above. This will put it ahead of Three with 18 countries and Lyca on 17 . Carphone Warehouse's boss Graham Stapleton said the iD website will launch tomorrow, where people can register their interest.

In terms of next steps, Mr Stapleton said the website will launch tomorrow where people can register their interest, and the network as a platform will launch in May - although he didn't give an exact date. Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now said to be looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. The firm will also be launching an app to manage billing and then new features will be announced during the summer that Mr Stapleton described as 'just fantastic and very innovative.' The full range of plans and offers will be announced as they become available, but an example plan offers the Samsung A3 on a 12-month 4G plan with 300 mins, 5,000 texts and 1 GB data for £19.50.

'We want this network to be focused on the individual and we will continue to listen to customers over the coming months, asking them to help develop and evolve iD.'

Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'It's quite a coup that iD piggybacks off Three's network given that Carphone Warehouse hasn't offered any deals from the network in years. Perhaps iD Mobiles was the olive branch. 'The promise of 12-month contracts is likely to be a major win with mobile users who crave flexibility - we know that because of the rising popularity of SIM-only deals. 'But iD's success all hinges on how keenly these shorter contracts are priced. We eagerly await more concrete details, in terms of cost and the full range of handsets that will be offered.'

Police arrested the teen mother on one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm. She was taken to a juvenile facility. Police department spokesman Aaron Patty told CNN affiliate KVVU that the ""infant did not receive the proper care and nourishment that she needed at the time, which is what led to the arrest of the 17-year-old.""

Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't happen as a manager you do get frustrated,' said Monk, who knows victory will take Swansea past their previous best Premier League points total of 47. 'That's what it boiled down to. But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point.

'A Facebook post cannot convey our pride and respect right now.' Classes will not be run as normal on Wednesday as the majority of teachers and many students will be attending Ms Scott's funeral. Just days before, the school made an touching gesture, sending a supportive message to the entire school community to acknowledge the grief they may feel as they face the daunting task of returning to the campus. 'Tomorrow is the start of what will be the most difficult week of school life for both students and teachers,' the Leeton High School Facebook page wrote. 'We will be aided by a large number of people in supportive roles and there are several individuals and organisations to whom we offer so much gratitude.' The country high school called on the school to unite together, to be understanding and to take strength from the support they can offer each other. Stephanie Scott (right), pictured with her fianc Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday . 'More importantly though, we have each other,' the post continues. 'Rest assured, if you stumble or fall, you will do so into the safe hands of many who care about you.' 'At other times, your hands could be needed and we know you will be there.' 'For Steph. For our school. For our town. For each other.' The high school was the last known location of Ms Scott before the 26-year-old went missing on Easter Sunday - less than a week before her wedding to fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. The drama and English teacher returned to the school alone that day to preparing lessons for the teachers who would replace her while she was on her honeymoon. Instead tragedy struck and the 26-year-old's body was found by police in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, the following Friday afternoon. On the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley a memorial was held. Her body was tragically found the day before . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service on the day he had been due to marry the love of his life, Stephanie Scott . School cleaner Vincent Stanford, 24, has been charged with her murder and is due to appear in court in June. Stephanie Scott's sister Robyn commented on Leeton High School's Facebook post on Sunday evening, addressing a beautiful message to the students who meant so much to her sister. 'Just remember what my beautiful sister Stephanie loved. Teaching all you amazing students and seeing your smiling faces,' wrote Robyn. 'You are the ones who made her want to be the most amazing teacher, friend and person she could be. 'Be strong, Leeton. For Steph. And know she will be with you all in spirit as I know she is with her family and friends. Xxxxxxxxx.' The school has made counselling services available for students and held 'community support coffee mornings' to help bring staff, students and parents together during the school holidays. 'A community united grows stronger,' the school vowed. A vigil has been created at the school where the popular 26-year-old teacher taught drama and English .

It's not just about style ‚î he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho's teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist ‚î Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what's necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho's brand is winning. Arsene Wenger (left) pushed Jose Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win . TALKING TACTICS . Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren't allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger's side were stifled ‚î they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003. Jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death. But Arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and John Terry, who are not the quickest. Keown (right) and Wenger go back a long way, after Keown's two stints at Arsenal during his career . Chelsea boss Mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against Wenger . CHANGE THE RECORD . Mourinho's record over Wenger is remarkable. Not many managers can say they have never lost to Arsene Wenger. Jose feels he knows Wenger's game and the Arsenal boss can't surprise him. I'd be amazed if Chelsea go all out to attack, but they will still pack a punch on the break. FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH . Jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the Premier League Manager of the Month award. He has only won it three times, the same as Alan Curbishley and one fewer than Joe Kinnear. Wenger has won it 14 times. THE CESC DIFFERENCE . Cesc Fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at Chelsea but I don't think he would have necessarily benefited Arsenal had he joined. That central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted Aaron Ramsey's progress. But one thing is certain on Sunday ‚î he won't receive a warm welcome. Mourinho has a poor Premier League Manager of the Month record; he has won as many as Alan Curbishley .

'The preponderance of scientific evidence is on the side of the president in making this argument. And the president believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today after he was asked about a Duke study that claimed the earth isn't heating up as quickly as expected. He then added, without any nudging, 'And there are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny that fact because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters.' Earnest's channeling of former Vice President Al Gore, star of the 2006 global warming documentary an Inconvenient Truth, followed the president's gas-guzzling, 1,836 mile trip on Wednesday, Earth Day, to the Florida Everglades aboard Air Force One. The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. The president is seen here on Wednesday, Earth Day, boarding Air Force One before departing from Florida. There he mocked opponents of climate change and said global warming is a 'problem now' There he preached about the harmful effects of global warming on the environment and the economy and mocked skeptics of man-made climate change. 'Climate change can no longer be denied,' he said. 'And action can no longer be delayed.' 'This is a not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' The president's spokesman did not name-check opponents of Obama's argument on climate change today but it was evident that he was referring to conservatives such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. The author of the anti-global warming book, The Greatest Hoax, Inhofe, has been a vocal critic of the administration's environmental policies. In late February he brought a snowball to the upper chamber's floor and presented it as evidence that global warming is a farce. 'It's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,' Inhofe, chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said and threw the snowball at the Senate president. Obama scoffed at the Republican lawmaker's antics in his Wednesday speech saying, 'yes, this winter was cold in some parts of this country, including Washington.' 'Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact,' he noted. Taking a shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who allegedly banned the phrase climate change from his employees' vernacular, Obama said that 'simply refusing to say the words ""climate changed"" doesn't mean that climate change isn't happening.' 'If you've got a coming storm, you don't stick your head in the sand,' he said. 'You prepare for the storm.' He said at another point in his remarks that climate change cannot be 'edited out' or 'omitted from the conversation.' 'There are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny' that global warming is happening 'because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today . Responding to the question today about the Duke study, Earnest said 'the president is demonstrating genuine leadership by challenging the country and the world to confront [global warming].' Furthermore, he said, the president is going about it in a way that will 'not just safeguard the American people,' but one that can also have 'significant benefits for our economy.' Wind and solar power, he said, do stand to yield long term benefits for the United States' economy if it makes an early investment in alternative energy sources.

Reynolds filed suit this week against the Food and Drug Administration alleging that the FDA is violating the companies' free speech rights. In March, the FDA issued guidance that if significant changes are made to a product's label, like color or a logo, the product requires new approval from the administration. This holds true even if the product was previously approved. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, argues that those guidelines go too far and are too vague. They violate the First Amendment because they pre-emptively restrict free speech and exceed the scope of the Tobacco Control Act, the companies claim. The FDA's actions, the suit says, do not advance a substantial government interest. The plaintiffs also include U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., American Snuff Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co.

The Republic entertain the Group D leaders at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday evening looking for a victory which would take them level with the Poles and get their campaign back on track after November's 1-0 defeat in Scotland. However, Martin O'Neill has left his players in little doubt that preventing Lewandowski from doing what he does best is only one of the missions in which they must succeed if they are to prosper, with Arkadiusz Milik and Sebastian Mila also representing significant threats. Stephen Quinn (left) believes the Republic of Ireland musn't concentrate solely on Robert Lewandowski . Quinn said: 'I don't think we need to say too much about Lewandowski because we know exactly how much of a threat he is. But hopefully we can keep him quiet at the weekend. 'But they are strong all over. They are plying their trades throughout the European leagues and they have got a top striker in Lewandowski up front, so we all know how good they are. 'Poland are a strong side. We have watched a lot of videos on them throughout the week already. The manager doesn't want to leave any stone unturned going into it for set-pieces, et cetera. 'We know how strong they are and we have done our homework, so hopefully we can deal with that on Sunday. Lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the Euro 2016 qualfying campaign to date . 'We can't dwell on how good they are, we have got to look at our own qualities and try to apply them in the game on Sunday and get those three points that we really want. We have got our own pace down the flanks as well, so hopefully we can counteract that.' Lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the campaign to date, although they all came in Poland's 7-0 drubbing of minnows Gibraltar in Faro in September, and it was Milik and Mila who were on target to defeat world champions Germany in Warsaw the following month. Ireland compounded the Germans' woes three days later when they emerged from their trip to Gelsenkirchen with a 1-1 draw, courtesy of John O'Shea's injury-time equaliser, although their hopes of securing one of the two automatic qualification berths were dented by the reverse in Glasgow. That left the Republic, the Scots and Joachim Low's men locked together on seven points, three adrift of Poland, although Quinn is confident there will be no hangover from the disappointment at Celtic Park. Quinn and James McClean (right) in action during a Republic of Ireland training session on Monday . John O'Shea (left) celebrates scoring an injury-time equaliser against Germany in October, 2014 . He said: 'No, I don't think so. Obviously, we were disappointed with the result, but we can't dwell on that. 'It was a close game, it wasn't the prettiest, but if we keep looking back at that, then we are not going to be going forward, so we have just got to concentrate on this Poland game. 'That's gone now and we have got to look at our home form and try to get the three points here, which is most important.' Poland appear in 34th place in FIFA's latest rankings list with Ireland in 66th, and it has been to Ireland's detriment that they have not been able to see off teams ranked above them in their most recent campaigns. ROI manager Martin O'Neill will lead his side out against Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday . That is a situation which will have to change if they are to finish in the top two, and the significance of that will not be lost on a bumper crowd at the Aviva Stadium, the site of the former Lansdowne Road stage on which Jason McAteer captured the imagination of a nation by dumping Holland out of the World Cup back in 2001. Quinn said: 'As a boy growing up on the streets of Dublin, it's where everybody wants to be. Sometimes you pinch yourself, but being out on that pitch and playing for your country, you can't beat it.

A gambling addict stole more than £22,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number, cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to £200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing £22,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just £1,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said: 'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing. 'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said: 'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that £1,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow.

But during an embarrassing interview on the ABC's 7.30 program, the Mr Andrews declined to reveal the brutal regime's leader. Scroll down for video . Defence Minister Kevin Andrew was unable to name the leader of Islamic State on ABC's 7.30 . When host Leigh Sales asked him to name the terror group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mr Andrews claimed he was unable to do so for 'operational reasons'. 'Can you name the leader of IS?' Sales asked. Mr Andrews replied: 'I'm not going to go into operational matters.' But Sales would not let him off the hook, saying: 'I don't think that's operational, I think it's a matter of public record.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is leader of notorious terrorist organisation Islamic State, which is wrestling to take power in Syria and Iraq . Sales continued, saying given the U.S. government had a $10 million bounty on his head, she was 'surprised' he couldn't name the terrorist leader. Mr Andrews argued I.S. did not just have one leader because it was made of many groups and there was not just one individual involved. Earlier that day, the Prime Minister announced Australian troops would return to Iraq with the aim to provide Iraqi security forces with the skills and training to defend their country, to degrade and ultimately defeat the forces of Islamic State or Daesh. Mr Andrews said Australian troops would not accompany the Iraqi forces they train into battle. 'No, they stay, to use the expression, inside the wire. They won't be going outside the Taji base. All the training will take place there,' he told ABC television. Mr Andrews was appearing on 7.30 following the Federal Government's announcement 330 troops would be leaving for Iraq . This is a stark contrast with deployments over the past decade when troops conducted sweeping patrols across southern Iraq, occasionally contacting insurgent forces. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced on Tuesday his cabinet had given the go-ahead for deployment of Task Force Taji, 330 Australian and 100 new Zealand troops to train Iraqi soldiers for the next two years. Mr Abbott said Iraq was a dangerous place and the mission was not risk-free. The joint force deployment this week coincides with the centenary of Anzac. Mr Andrews said the mission would be reviewed continually but there would be a formal review after 12 months. He said there had been an improvement with Iraqi forces ousting Daesh from the city of Tikrit. 'So we are confident that there will be more gains over the next year to two and that's what we've made a commitment to,' he said.

The towers, costing the Polish government £2.5million, will range from 115ft to 164ft and help monitor the 124mile long border between the two countries using CCTV. The increased border monitoring comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and Poland, a member of both NATO and the European Union, over the conflict in Ukraine. Keeping an eye out: Poland is erecting watchtowers along the border to Russian exclave Kaliningrad (pictured) as tensions between the two countries are heightened . Last month, Moscow announced plans on placing state-of-the-art Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad for what government representatives called a 'major military exercise'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been accused of singling out Poland as an enemy in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, accusing it of training 'Ukrainian nationalists' and instigating unrest. 'We are currently in the test phase of the technical installations on the towers,' MirosÇawa Aleksandrowicz from the Warmia-Masurian Border Guard told the PAP news agency. The construction of the watchtowers, due to be finished in June, is set to cost the Polish government 14million zloty (£2.5million) with a majority of the funding coming from the EU's External Borders Fund. Kaliningrad, which has a population of just under 1million, plays an important role in the maintenance of the Russian Baltic fleet. Getting ready: The CCTV towers will will monitor the border between Poland and Kaliningrad, where Moscow recently announced they are set to place state-of-the-art Iskander missiles . When neighbouring countries Poland and Lithuania joined the EU in May 2004, strict border controls were imposed. Moscow has proposed visa-free travel between Kaliningrad and the EU several times, but the motions have been rejected. The new border watchtowers will be erected at a time when tension around the Baltic Sea is reaching new heights. Last month, Swedish Air Force and NATO jets tracked four Russian combat aircraft - two long-range, nuclear-capable Tu-22M3 bombers and two Sukhoi Su-27 fighters - flying with their transponders turned off in international airspace over the Baltic Sea. NATO said it scrambled Danish jets and Italian jets based in Lithuania to identify the Russian aircraft which it said were heading to Kaliningrad. 'The Russian military aircraft did not use their onboard transponder; they were not in contact with civilian Air Traffic Control and they were not on a pre-filed flight plan,' a NATO military officer said. Last month, Russian military maneuvers that spread from the Arctic to the Black Sea involved 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft.",194,64,"russian, russia, european, europe, ukraine, putin, moscow, greece, eastern, euro,","group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","Ukraine and Russia, called to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathered in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, bloc of nations within the European Union","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","This topic is about Ukraine and Russia, calling to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathering in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, and a bloc of nations within the European Union.","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","The Polish government has been working on two watchtowers bordering the Russian city of Kaliningrad.

A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors"" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. ""There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't,"" a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN.

Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. ""I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them,"" Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" he said before the 2014 Games.

Emma Thair-White, 43, was prompted to lose weight after she gorged so much that whole pieces of food rose back up into her throat when she bent over to tie her shoelaces. The mother-of-two, who said she over-ate while grieving following her mother's death, was hugely successful and went from a 15-stone, size 22 to a ten-stone, size 12. Emma Thair-White piled on the pounds after the tragic loss of her mother, however, the 43-year-old has now dropped five dress sizes and had a boob job to lift and enlarge her sagging chest . Emma was left devastated after the death of her mother, Ethel (right) and turned to drink and food for comfort . But her breasts also took the hit ‚ and shrunk from a 38E to a 34B. 'I didn't want to look in the mirror ‚ I didn't like what it the weight loss had left,' she said, adding she was disgusted with her 'saggy' breasts. 'Every bra I put on, the skin just sat in there. I'd never lost my boobs throughout any diet, so it was a shock.' In 2014, she decided to use part of her mum's inheritance to get a breast uplift and 34F implants. Mrs Thair-White, from Grays, Essex, said: 'I wasn't sure about spending part of the inheritance on the operation but my husband Shane encouraged me,' she said. 'He said: 'You've always put the kids first, now it's time for you.' Mrs Thair-White told how she struggled to shift the pounds she had gained while pregnant with her children Eva, 16 and Max, 10, but her binge eating spiraled out of control after she lost her beloved mother Ethel to brain cancer in 2009. Emma, pictured here with her two children Eva (left) and Max (right) decided to lose the weight in 2013 after she became so big that she couldn't tie her shoelaces without food coming up into her mouth . Emma proudly shows off her weight loss holding up an old pair of her jeans, she was previously a size 22 but has now slimmed down to a size 12 . Emma is now a keen exerciser and a slim size 12, after realising in 2013 that she needed to do something about her weight . She was so devastated by the loss that she secretly turned to drink to ease the pain. 'It started off that I had a bottle of wine to toast [my mum], and things seemed a little bit rosier and it wasn't so painful,' she said. 'That one glass in the evening turned to two, then three, then four and then before I knew it I'd be ordering three bottles of wine in the shopping then, unbeknown to my husband, going and buying another three. 'I used to make sure if there was a lot of bottles in the recycling bin I'd put the rubbish straight in after. He didn't have a clue.' In 2010, she broke down and confessed all to her GP, who prescribed her a course of anti-depressants. 'One day I just woke up and decided I wasn't going to do it anymore and I needed help,' she said. She cut out drinking straight away. Emma was suffering from depression when she decided to give up drinking, however, she then turned to take-aways eating them two or three times a week . Emma is now happy to show off her slimmer figure in a variety of outfits, including this fancy dress costime . However, Mrs Thair-White was still battling with her weight ‚ a fight she believes was made harder by her anti-depressants. 'The takeaways went from weekends to two or three times a week,' she said. It wasn't a few scoops of Ben and Jerry's, I'd have the tub. 'With my appetite, there is no off button. It is all down to my self control.' Classmates at son her Max's school even made cruel comments about him having a 'fat mum.' The final push she needed to kick-start her weight loss came in December 2013. She had been stocking the house with sweets and chocolate in the run-up to Christmas, but could not resist binging on the treats. 'I stacked up my cupboards and I used to sit and eat every night until I felt sick,' she said, 'We were going somewhere and I bent down to tie my shoes then all my food came back into my mouth because my tummy was so big. 'I just remember saying to my husband: 'I can't do this anymore.' Emma used some of the inheritance money left by her mother to pay for a boob job after her chest was left sagging following her weight loss regime . Emma's two children and husband encouraged her in her weight loss, they joined their mother on her healthy eating regime, promising her they would lose weight as a family . Her 42-year-old husband and two children also joined in with her new healthy regime, promising they would lose weight as a family. Mrs Thair-White threw herself into exercise, taking the family's dog Morris with her on speed walks. Progress was slow at first. When she had only managed to shed a stone after several months, she turned to Forza Raspberry K2 diet supplements. 'At the beginning when I wasn't on [the supplements], it was very slow,' she said, 'But after I started, it came off in leaps and bounds. 'The shape change spurred me on. I had a waist ‚ it was a good feeling. The biggest thing is excuses. 'I've had so many people approach me and say they want to do it but there's all these 'buts', and I'll say to them that they're not ready. 'You've got to be in the frame of mind to do it. I've proved that you don't have to run ‚ I speed walk. 'Even just walking helps, it's just making yourself active. I just want people to know there is always light at the end of any tunnel no matter how big or small, and looking after yourself really does make all the difference. Don't give up. It can be done.'

273,30ZX6P7VFAXJI01EOU2EHDQDHZOJ2J,833dfb87fab3d018ba2a10d04f1faef4be357fa3,"A former NFL player has revealed that his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost for 'raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted into the professional league. Phillip Buchanon was a first-round draft pick for the Oakland Raiders, and seventeenth overall, when his mother made the request in 2002. Buchanon, who also played for the Houston Texans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins before retiring in 2011, discussed the incident in his recently released book New Money: Stay Rich. 'If my mother taught me anything, it's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child,' he wrote in an exclusive excerpt released to Fox Sports. Former NFL player Phillip Buchanon (pictured here playing for the Oakland Raiders) has revealed his mother demanded he pay her one million dollars as the cost 'for raising him for the last 18 years' after he was drafted . 'The covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible, and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect.' But after years, Buchanon said he realized that his mother and family members were different - especially when money became involved. He told Fox Sports that he wrote the book to make sure 'the next generation of athletes doesn't make the same mistakes' he did when he finally got paid the big NFL bucks. Buchanon said he followed the 'unwritten NFL New Money Millionaire' rule and instead bought his mother a brand new big house, as well as paid for all her finances that did not include food or entertainment. But he soon realized that gift would come with its own problems. Instead of selling her old house, like he advised, Buchanon's mother rented it to his aunt. This left Buchanon paying for mortgage and maintenance payments for both houses for seven years. Buchanon asks rookies to consider certain questions before buying their family 'big-ticket purchases', such as whether the family member would be able to make the payments if they couldn't, or if the family member expected them to pay for upkeep 20 years later. The former football star said his mother never offered him the money she made from her sister's rent, and later blamed him for 'messing up her life' after he kicked her boyfriend out of the house he paid for. 'What she didn't see was that her boyfriend was pimping her and me out,' he wrote. 'He wasn't bringing anything to the table, just taking.' Buchanon said he bought his mother a house instead, which brought its own set of problems for years . Buchanon (pictured playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) said his relatives also asked him for money, claiming they needed a check to pay for repairs and bills . Buchanon said he eventually became fed up and told his mother he would stop paying for her new house's upkeep after he paid off the mortgage. When his mother said the house was too large for her to afford the maintenance, he offered to buy her a smaller house that he would pay for with cash and put in his name, protecting her from loans and giving his brothers and sisters a stable home. Instead, his mother asked for $15,000 in cash. She ended up losing the home. 'She told me that if the new house didn't have space for two living room sets, she didn't want it,' Buchanon writes. Buchanon said he moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' in a home where his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted'. And the football player said he soon realized it wouldn't just be his mother asking him for money, but his relatives as well, who often had 'family emergencies'. Buchanon (pictured with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) moved out of his house at 17 because he no longer 'felt secure' at home because his mother let people 'come in and out of the house and take what they wanted' Buchanon said at first he would just write his relatives a check, which he said would 'always get cashed' even as the problems never got fixed. That's when Buchanon said he started offering to pay for the 'emergencies' directly to the mechanics or companies the money was supposedly owed to, only to have his relatives say 'forget about it'. Buchanon said he spent 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' before learning how to deal with his family's monetary demands. But he said it was the way his mother treated him that ended up teaching Buchanon 'the most important lessons in life'. 'The mothers and fathers of the world have been rearing their kids for generations - in every culture imaginable - and it's a one-way street when it comes to money,' he writes. 'If they pay you back someday, and you really are going through hard times, then that's just a bonus, a gratuity for being a great mother or father.'",128,115,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","Phillip Buchanon, former NFL player, has revealed that his mother asked him to pay her $1M, which she tagged as the price for raising him, after he was drafted. Instead, Phillip explained that he bought his mother a huge home, paid for extravagant non-essential expenses, but she continued to spend money and blame him for any resulting problems. He eliminated her debts and mortgages, but she required more cash and allowed people to use her for money and keep asking Phillip for more.","Phillip Buchanan, former NLF player, reveals in his new book ""New Money: Stay rich"" how his mom and other family members used him for his money. His mother demanded $1M in return for raising him. While he didn't pay, he did buy her a home and spent large sums on other items. While he was attempting to give his brothers and sisters a stable home, his mom was more interested in taking cash and ended up losing the house. Many other family members would report ""family emergencies"" in order to get money from Buchanon. He slowly learned his lesson and goes on to say it was the most important lesson in life."

Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. ""When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors,"" Borek said. ""Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth."" Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night.

The teen, who has not been named because he is a juvenile, and 22-year-old James McLamb have been charged in the death. Police are seeking a third suspect but say they know his identity. The group was near a McDonald's in Stamford, Connecticut last Wednesday when Antonio Muralles left the fast-food restaurant with a cup of coffee and accidentally bumped into the boy. 'Words were exchanged and then without warning, he was viciously attacked and stabbed through the heart - a very heinous, tragic incident,' Captain Richard Conklin told the Stamford Advocate. Scroll down for video . Accused: James McLamb, 22, has been charged in the death of a 52-year-old man who was stabbed to death in Stamford, Connecticut last week. McLamb's 15-year-old friend allegedly carried out the stabbing . Police said Muralles was also slapped and beaten with a stick. Lieutenant Deidrich Hohn said that the juvenile was responsible for the stabbing, while McLamb assaulted the man,Fox CT reported. Muralles collapsed on a street corner around 10.15pm and was seen by emergency responders who happened to be passing. He was rushed to hospital but died several hours later. Police said information from a narcotics officer's informant helped them hone in on the attackers. With that information, they looked through hundreds of hours of video surveillance tape from different downtown cameras and were able to place them in the area of the stabbing. Police then received a call from a witness - which they said is rare - and she was able to provide them further information that ultimately led to the arrests. Murdered: Antonio Muralles, left, had accidentally spilled coffee on McLamb, right, and his friends . Police are still seeking a third suspect in the crime. McLamb was arrested on an unrelated weapons charge on Saturday and was transferred to Stamford on Monday to be arraigned. He is being held in lieu of $2 million bond. McLamb didn't enter a plea.

She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million. Of course that was long before the, ""there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,"" interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy. I simply adored her ... I still do. As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate. Girls' names are causing the biggest stir, as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess. If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one. In choosing a name, titled royals tend to turn to the family tree, rather than a well-thumbed copy of ""1,001 Best Baby Names"" like the rest of us. Traditionally they pick dynastic names, and there are plenty to choose from: Elizabeth, Alice, Victoria and Charlotte have all been frontrunners, but the sentimental favorite among punters remains Diana. In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice. That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana. Today Diana's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself: while some have virtually sainted her, others have been vehemently critical, accusing her of being childish, unhinged and self-serving. Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy. In the years since Earl Spencer's scathing attack on the Windsors at Diana's funeral, the nation has moved on and Diana's legacy has been celebrated. She has become a part of royal history. Her memory has been preserved, and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity. Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it. Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry. Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion. He has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes. At his wedding in 2011 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, a close friend of Diana and executor of her will, gave the address. The hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was sung at both Diana's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007, was chosen for the royal wedding. Julia Samuel, another close friend of Diana, was asked to serve as Godmother to Prince George. William chose Kensington Palace, his own childhood home, to be the primary residence for his family, and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother's memory, he gave Kate Diana's engagement ring. William doesn't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her; he does so by being a good husband and father. I still miss Diana. She was a one-off, and I don't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her. Daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already Kate's cross to bear. Shouldn't a baby girl be spared the same fate? Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come. She wouldn't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow. She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.",115,211,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","london, british, uk, britain, royal, prince, william, harry, england, princess,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, British royal family, second in line to the throne, the royal couple","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, the British royal family, the second in line to the throne, and the royal couple.","Speculation around the birth of royal baby, potentially a girl.

Less than a month later and Simeone's men were at it again, this time defeating Los Blancos in their own backyard in La Liga.

Atletico's third win against Real this season arrived in January when the two sides met in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey.

Our glorious spring has accelerated the growing season - and supermarket shelves are already bursting with English summer fruit and veg. Usually at this time of year we would still be eating vegetables imported from Spain and South America. But thanks to endless days of sun and temperatures we would not expect until August, English tomatoes and asparagus are already on the shelves, weeks ahead of usual. Waitrose announced yesterday the early arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year. It is stocking large Jack Hawkins, aromatic Red Choice and tiny Baby Plums, all grown in greenhouses across England. And the supermarket has been stocking asparagus since the beginning of the month. Strawberries are also already on the shelves - far earlier than normal - and English raspberries saw their earliest ever appearance in the last week of March. Morrisons, meanwhile, yesterday predicted Britain would have best crop of asparagus for nearly a decade. The chain estimates that the asparagus crop could be up 20 per cent this year compared to average, having received an early boost of high light levels and warm temperatures. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: 'Growing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. 'The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.' Peter Cooke, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: 'Our customers can choose from a wide variety of home grown tomatoes and in bigger quantities than this time last year.' The sunny spell is set to continue until later this week, when the weather will take a turn for the worst. The mercury is set to hit 21C (70F) as the Queen celebrates her 89th birthday today (Tuesday) - making it hotter than Ibiza, Athens and Barcelona. But rain, cloud and cooler temperatures are predicted for the second half of the week.

Showers could hit the capital this Sunday as tens of thousands of runners take part in the London Marathon. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the Met Office, said most of Britain basked in sunshine yesterday and will continue to enjoy good weather until Wednesday. He said: 'There has been lots of sunshine around and the temperatures have been pretty decent for this time of year - temperatures have hit 19C in Sussex and 18C in London. But he added: 'By Thursday a lot more cloud will be around in general and there will be light rain over Scotland. 'For most it will be a dry day still with some sunny spells, but generally that cloud is the herald of slightly more unsettled weather. 'The high pressure that has been dominating for the past few days moves over and we see a bit more of what you would expect this time of year.'",218,48,"snow, weather, cold, winter, temperatures, conditions, hot, morning, expected, parts,","food, restaurant, eat, eating, babies, meal, drinks, fruit, breakfast, chicken,","winter temperatures, hot weather conditions, a cold morning, snow is expected later","eating food at a restaurant, a healthy meal, ordering something to drink, serving breakfast, fruits are a healthy food, eating chicken","This topic is about winter temperatures as opposed to hot weather conditions, cold mornings, and weather forecasts like snow being expected later.","This topic is about eating food at a restaurant, ordering something to drink and serving breakfast, as well as eating chicken, and fruits which are a healthy food.","Waitrose yesterday announced the earliest arrival of its first British tomatoes of the year.

The blob in the ocean was discovered last year, with temperatures one to four degrees Celsius (two to seven degrees Fahrenheit) above surrounding 'normal' water. And the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles (1,600km) offshore, from Mexico up to Alaska, and could herald a warmer summer for some regions. Scroll down for video . A 'blob' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the Pacific Ocean (shown in diagram). Since last June it has extended from Alaska to Mexico. It has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere. And a new University of Washington study says it could be responsible for droughts . A new study by the University of Washington found that a high-pressure ridge could be causing the blob, by trapping heat in the water. In June of last year, the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles (1,600km) in each direction, and was 300ft (90 metres) deep. Dr Nick Bond, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, coined the term 'the blob' in June. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Ten months later, the blob is now squashed up against the coast, and Dr Bond says all models point to it continuing through the end of this year. 'In the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big, almost circular mass of water that just didn't cool off as much as it usually did, so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year,' said Dr Bond. Researchers said it may have contributed to the state of Washington's mild 2014 winter and might signal a warmer summer. But exactly how this area of warmer water has formed, or how long it will stay, remains a mystery. One thing that can be studied, though, is its effects. As air passes over warmer water and reaches the coast it brings more heat and less snow, which the scientists say helped cause current drought conditions in California, Oregon and Washington. The researchers said that it might not only be causing warmer temperatures on the West coast, but also cooler temperatures on the East coast. It could also be playing a part in circulating cold and wet air to the central and eastern states of the US. California's drought (stock image shown left) is one of the worst on record, while the East coast of the US (Central Park in New York shown right) has seen unusually cold temperatures . It is also having an effect on marine life. Fish have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water. Dr Bond noted that, while this phenomenon likely wasn't caused by global warming, it could be a sign of similar weather to come. 'This is a taste of what the ocean will be like in future decades,' Dr Bond said. 'It wasn't caused by global warming, but it's producing conditions that we think are going to be more common with global warming.' The 'blob' is also having an effect on marine life.

Arsenal were unable to break down their opponents in an attritional game, while Jose Mourinho's side rarely troubled David Ospina. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his verdict from the Emirates Stadium... Arsenal . David Ospina - Lucky not concede a penalty after clattering into Oscar - but produced a good stop to deny Ramires. 6.5 . Hector Bellerin - The youngster was preferred to fit again Mathieu Debuchy and justified his manager's faith. 7 . David Ospina was fortunate to get away without conceding a penalty when he clattered Oscar . Hector Bellerin does well to clear the ball off the line to prevent Oscar's lob putting Chelsea ahead . Laurent Koscielny - Cruised through the first half owing to Chelsea playing with no striker. Had more to think about following's Drogba's introduction. 7 . Per Mertesacker - Patched up after sustaining an ankle injury last weekend. Showed little sign of the problem in a strong performance. 7.5 . Nacho Monreal - Steady game for the Spaniard. Looks to be edging ahead of Kieran Gibbs for position as No 1 left-back. Booked. 6.5 . Francis Coquelin - Had to walk a disciplinary tightrope after a first-half booking - but remained industrious as ever.7 . Francis Coquelin breaks up a Chelsea attack but his holding role was made more difficult by a booking . Santi Cazorla - He's had more influential days, but kept Arsenal's midfield ticking over. Booked. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey - Utilised, once again, in an unfamiliar right-wing role. It didn't throw him off his stride too much. Booked. 6.5 . Mesut Ozil - Not quite £42.5million, but he's getting there. Heavily involved for the Gunners but couldn't find a breakthrough. 7 . Alexis Sanchez - Fresh from his Wembley double, the Chilean wasn't quite at his best against Chelsea. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud - Endured a titanic battle with Terry. The Frenchman put himself about against the champions-elect. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud shields the ball from a masked Cesc Fabregas, but the Frenchman had little joy up front . Subs: . Danny Welbeck (on for Coquelin, 76) - Injected pace into Arsenal's attack. 6.5 . Theo Walcott (on for Giroud, 84) - Thrown on late as the Gunners searched for victory. 6.5 . Subs not used: Szczesny, Debuchy, Gibbs, Wilshere, Flamini . Manager: Arsene Wenger - His Mourinho hoodoo continues - but the French manager can be happy with his side. 6. Chelsea . Thibault Courtois - Made some routine saves but has had much more eye-catching afternoons. 6.5 . Branislav Ivanovic - Solid and steady as ever from the Blues right-back. Excellent tussle with Sanchez. Booked. 7 . Gary Cahill - A mature display from the England central-defender. Kept his cool in the heat of battle. 7.5 . John Terry - Played a crucial role in quelling Giroud's aerial threat. A typical all-action display from the Chelsea skipper. 8 . John Terry and Gary Cahill did well to prevent Giroud from becoming a threat as Chelsea kept things tight . Cesar Azpilicueta - Been one of Chelsea's most consistent players this season. Was so again at the Emirates. 7.5 . Nemanja Matic - Shielded his back-four with the expertise we've come to expect. Didn't put a foot wrong. 7 . Cesc Fabregas - Booed on his return to Emirates and booked for diving. Wasn't how he'd dreamed it last night. 6 . Ramires - Missed a glorious chance to put Chelsea ahead in the first half. Defensive instincts were vital for Chelsea. 6.5 . Ramires carries the ball past Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal in the top of the table clash . Willian - A willing runner in attack and defence for the Blues. Showed some quality on ball, too. Booked. 6.5 . Eden Hazard - He's had more productive days, but his defensive discipline was important for the visitors. 6 . Oscar - Playing in an unfamiliar role as central striker, he should have won Chelsea a penalty. Did little much else. 6 . Eden Hazard was unusually quiet, with Arsenal keeping a close eye on him, but still showed flashes of quality . Subs: . Didier Drogba (on for Oscar, 46) - So often Arsenal's tormentor. Could replicate past heroics. 6 . Kurt Zouma (on for Fabregas, 90) - Brought on to see out the final few minutes. 6 . Juan Cuadrado (on for Willian, 90) - Came on for the final few seconds. 6 . Manager: Jose Mourinho - Starting with no striker said it all. Came for a point - and got it. Job done. 7 .

Fighters from 100 nations ‚ more than half the countries in the world ‚ have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video . More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations . The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in 'a veritable ""international finishing school"" for extremists' as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March ‚ three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters 'is higher than it has ever been historically'. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory . The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has 'risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,' the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the 'watch list' in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it's possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the 'high number'of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks 'pose an immediate and long-term threat' and 'an urgent global security problem' that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack 'is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues'. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is 'generating public panic' and stressed that the response needs to 'be measured, effective and proportionate.' It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.",64,12,"group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","islamic, terror, terrorist, al, threat, iraq, attacks, terrorists, terrorism, threats,","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","terrorist attack, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threat, extremist groups","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","This topic is about terrorist attacks, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threats, and extremist groups.",There are 100 nations fighters are joined a Al Qaeda and Islamic State military.If the IS will lose the war some fighters from IS are scattered in the world.

A teacher who taught at Sir Chris Hoy's former school has left a share of the £2million fortune she made from stocks and shares to help children from poorer backgrounds. Mary Cowan, 92, generously ordered that a large slice of her estate should be given to George Watson's College in Edinburgh where she had devoted years of her life to teaching primary school children. Ms Cowan, of Edinburgh, passed away in November last year but her will revealed she asked for a bursary scheme to be set up in her name at the school where famous faces such as Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy and rugby legend Gavin Hastings were taught. Ms Cowan never married and worked and lived in Edinburgh her whole adult life, retiring from her job at the college in 1981. She started off teaching pupils of primary school age, before working her way up to be assistant headmistress. She was raised with her brother Martin in Kirkcudbrightshire, where her family had lived for generations and ran a grocer shop, before moving to the city where she lived in a modest semi-detached house which sold for £490,000 in 2012. Her published will has now revealed that she had an estate worth nearly £2million and asked that more than £700,000 be given to friends and family. The bulk of her wealth was made up of a stocks and shares portfolio and she left instructions for the remainder to be handed over to good causes. The Mary Cowan Bursary will have funds of around £325,000 and will be used to help current or prospective poorer pupils attend the school. A group of trustees will decide if applicants are successful. Ms Cowan also asked that Falkirk High School be given a share of her estate to set up a fund in memory of her mother called the 'The Jane Martin Waddell Prize' that would see outstanding pupils recognised for academic achievements. Other groups which can expect windfalls include The Royal National Institute of Blind People, Blind Veterans UK, Christian Aid, and The Salvation Army. Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh, where Ms Cowan was a well-known member of the congregation, Alzheimer Scotland, and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children have also been included in her will. Ms Cowan stated in her will that a bursary scheme should be set up in her name at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, where she taught. She left around £325,000 to the fund to help poorer pupils attend the school . Ms Cowan, of Edinburgh, asked in her will for a bursary scheme to be set up in her name at George Watson's College where famous faces such as Sir Chris Hoy (left) and rugby legend Gavin Hastings (right) were taught . Reverend Derek Browning of Morningside Parish Church paid tribute to the generous former teacher. He said: 'First and foremost she was a teacher - and her passion for Watson's was second to none.

Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh . Alzheimer Scotland . The Royal Hospital for Sick Children . 'Ms Cowan was supremely proud of her school, and delighted to work alongside staff who shared her commitment to educating the young. 'I know that her influence and her enthusiasm have touched many lives, and she remembered her students with pleasure and affection.' He added: 'Church was her other great passion. She loved her church, and did everything she could to help those in it. 'She was the epitome of a Christian lady. 'She taught by example, she lived by faith, she enjoyed so many things, and was interested in just about everything.' Melvyn Roffe, principal of George Watson's College, said: 'Mary Cowan was well known in the Watson's community having taught many generations of pupils and we were very sad to hear of her recent death. 'Miss Cowan joined George Watson's Ladies College in George Square as a primary school teacher, also teaching French, in 1945 and taught until 1972 when she was appointed assistant head teacher in the primary school. Ms Cowan never married and had no children. She grew up in Kirkcudbrightshire before moving to Edinburgh where she lived for the rest of her life, including in this semi-detached property (right) for 20 years until 2012 . Ms Cowan also left money for Alzheimer Scotland and The Royal Hospital for Sick Children (pictured) 'She finally retired from Watson's in 1981. Throughout her life she was a great supporter of our Family Foundation. 'We are touched by the news that a trust created by her estate will fund the attendance at Watson's of many pupils whose family circumstances would not otherwise enable them to study here. 'It will help us to perpetuate the memory of a much loved and respected former member of staff and, of course, the legacy of our founder, George Watson himself.'

Yet the majority of the world's volcanoes are found deep underwater where immense water pressure does weird things to the lava that bubbles out of them. Now scientists have finally been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes - and they are surprisingly quiet for such a violent event. Scroll down to watch and listen to an underwater volcano erupting . The majority of the world's volcanoes are found deep underwater and now scientists have been able to record one of these eruptions as it happens to discover the sound it makes. The bubbling lava erupting from the volcanic vent Hades (above) produced a distinctive acoustic signature . Rather than the explosive roar emitted by their cousins on land, underwater volcanoes give off a muted thrum instead. However, the research could allow scientists to monitor undersea volcanoes far more effectively than they have before. Volcanoes lurking hidden under the world's oceans may play a far greater role in climate change than previously though. Scientists found that underwater volcanoes, which were long assumed to ooze lava at relatively steady rates, in fact erupt in pulses. A new study has shown that these submarine eruptions follow regular cycles that can range from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years. The researchers claim these eruptions appear to be linked to changes in the Earth's orbit that occur over time. Surprisingly the researchers also found that these eruptions also appear to be clustered during the first six months of each year. The findings may now mean that models predicting how human activity will change the climate will need to be adjusted. Volcanic eruptions are known to throw huge amounts of gas into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide that are thought to increase global warming. However, volcanoes also release aerosol gases that are now known to reduce global warming by creating a reflective barrier against the sun. Using their unique sound signature, researchers will be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately. Bob Dziak, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Newport, Oregon who led the research, said: 'Detecting seafloor volcanism is important because it is a very significant process in terms of chemical impacts on the ocean and natural hazards. 'Even though roughly 70 per cent of Earth's volcanic activity occurs under the water, it has remained largely unobserved. 'So, the more of these events that we can detect remotely using acoustics, the more we can understand Earth's processes and how the planet works.' Underwater volcanoes are known to be widespread on the floor of the world's oceans at joins in the tectonic plates. Most are located in the deep ocean, where their activity can be difficult to measure, although some in shallow water can erupt with enough lava to create new islands. Others erupt with explosive results. A recent study found that emissions from underwater volcanoes may play a far greater role in influencing the climate than had previously been believed. Rather than oozing lava at relatively steady rates, they in fact erupt in pulses that follow regular cycles ranging from just a couple of weeks to 100,000 years. In the latest study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists used an underwater vehicle to visit the West Mata Volcano, 3,937 feet (1,200 metres) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean near Samoa. Eruptions from underwater volcanoes can sometimes form new islands like this one off the coast of Japan. A recent study found that emissions from underwater volcanoes may play a far greater role in influencing the climate than had previously been believed . They found different eruptions were occurring at two of the volcano's vents ‚ nicknamed Hades and Prometheus. Hades produced large lava bubbles that were released slowly, while Prometheus gave off explosive releases of tiny gas bubbles. They managed to film the eruptions as they happened and using hydrophones, recorded the sound they produced. They then analysed the acoustic signatures produced by each explosion, showing they are different. The graph above shows the acoustic signature as lava bubbles from Hades volcano (marked by red arrows) Scientists have struggled to study underwater volcanoes like the one above as they are hard to spot erupting. Using their unique sound signature, researchers will now be able to detect different types of eruptions and record the gases being released far more accurately .

Retired chief executive Ren Dee watched as his wife Eileen, 68, slipped away just days after catching the infection and before the couple's son had a chance to say goodbye. The 69-year-old said: 'It was such a shock, one minute everyone was telling her how well she was doing and the next moment I am watching her struggling to breathe. It happened so quickly.' Ren Dee had to watch as his wife Eileen, 68, died just days after catching a lethal infection. She had been battling cancer when she caught the bug while undergoing treatment at the Royal Sussex County Hospital . Eileen had received a positive prognosis while being treated for her cancer but died because of an infection at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. Several hospital rooms, including Eileen's, were found to have traces of the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water running from the tap and in the shower drain. Raw sewage was also discovered coming up from the shower drain in the room next door to Eileen. Doctors, concerned for her health, transferred Eileen to another hospital while an exploration of drains and an intensive clean of all side rooms, including the one the retired NHS information manager was in, was carried out. The infection was specifically detected in Eileen's room but there were no notes accompanying her transfer to say that she had been exposed to the potentially lethal infection. She died five days later. The Royal Sussex had put new measures in place after an outbreak of the same infection in 2010, it has also emerged. These included a thorough review of cleaning rounds. But it was revealed following an internal Serious Incident Investigation that only about a third of hospital housekeepers were cleaning to the required standard when Eileen died. Initially, Eileen, who was diagnosed with acute myloid leukaemia, had been intent on just receiving palliative care because she had watched her mother die of cancer. But when she was told she would respond well to chemotherapy and had a good prospect of survival, she changed her mind. Mr Dee said: 'She was very scared and very worried about going through the process of what her mother went through, which was a very long, drawn-out process and very unpleasant. Legal action: Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence . 'They were just about to introduce her to another lady, of a similar age, who had been through the same condition and had successfully come out the other side. 'That was just about to happen and then suddenly she was gone.' He added: 'Eileen has missed out on the prospect of being a grandmother, which is something she would have loved. 'One of the most difficult decisions I have had to make was when to get my son, Matthew, home from overseas. But by the time I was very, very sure he should, and phoned him to say ""get over here now"", it was too late.' Healthy people are rarely affected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common bacteria, but it has become a major cause of healthcare-related infections, especially for those with compromised immune systems like Eileen's. The 68-year-old died in August 2013. Her cause of death was recorded as pneumonia but the Royal Sussex's report says the coroner should have been made aware of the infection. Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence. Melanie Minter, of Sussex law firm Mayo Wynne Baxter, said: ""We say there were serious errors and gross negligence in respect of cleaning the haematology oncology unit."" Last month, the Trust pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of putting patients at risk over a period of more than six years in relation to a separate outbreak of legionella.

But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. ""The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,"" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. ""We know how to address disease when we find it."" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus ""low"" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. ""That said, human infections have occurred"" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. ""We are cautiously optimistic"" that it won't spread to humans, but ""we are prepared for the possibility,"" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called ""torticollis"" or ""stargazing"" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA. So the cases should go down over the summer, but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the Fall.",72,187,"health, virus, cases, people, bird, outbreak, infected, public, sick, flu,","website, disease, spread, ill, contact, symptoms, infection, deaths, stomach, illness,","people infected with the virus, identify new cases, outbreak of measles, public health, new strain of flu, infected cases","the disease is spread through close contact, cases of illness or elevated levels of bacteria, symptoms of this disease include fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches","This topic is about people infected with the virus, identifying new cases, the outbreak of measles, public health, new strain of flu, and infected cases.","This topic is about the disease spreading through close contact, cases of illness or elevated levels of bacteria, and symptoms of the disease such as fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches.","The bird flu has become worse in U.S. and has become a headache for Centers for Disease control and prevention (CDC).

Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer stated that although this virus does not harm humans but still they are prepared to face it when it hits humans. To avoid spreading of this disease, more than 3.5 million birds were euthanized in U.S. CDC has mentioned that the virus cannot survive in warm weather and so they expect this virus count to come down in summer.","The bird flu has caused major issue in the U.S. Many new cases has been noted and it is also found out that the virus cannot be spread to humans.

Eric Carter and Stephanie McCassin, both of Manchester, were arrested on warrants Thursday, four months after the child's grandmother and primary caretaker, Mary MacDonald, reported finding the child in the tub, with the parents passed out on Dec. 4. Overdose: Eric Carter, 21 (right), and Stephanie McCassin, 24 (left), of New Hampshire, have been charged with endangering the welfare of a child after allegedly overdosing on heroin while giving their 3-year-old son a bath . Passed Out: The child's grandmother told authorities that she went to check on the parents (photographed) and the child in the bathroom and found the two passed out on the bathroom floor while the child remained in the tub . The child was not hurt. MacDonald told Fox Boston that she saw the parents in the bathroom with the boy but grew suspicious when the three became quiet in the room. She went to check on them, she said, and found the parents passed out on the bathroom floor as the child remained in the tub, seeming oblivious to the situation. MacDonald contacted authorities and removed the 3-year-old from the tub, according to the Boston Globe. Caretaker: The child's grandmother told authorities that she lives with her son, Carter (left), and is the primary caretaker of the three-year-old because of Carter's history with drugs . Twenty-one-year-old Carter and 24-year-old McCassin were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for an apparent heroin overdose.

The disruption is believed to have occurred during the same February 18 incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort two Russian bear bombers identified flying close to British airspace. The move was seen as a show of strength by Russia amid tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, where Prime Minister David Cameron has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of challenging the territorial integrity of Kiev. A file picture showing a Russian bear bomber being escorted by an RAF jet. A commercial plane carrying hundreds of passengers was forced to divert after an incursion into Irish air space by two Kremlin aircraft . The Irish authority said the two Russian aircraft were flying with their transponders switched off - devices that help aircraft to be identified by air traffic control radars.

They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast. 'One aircraft's departure from Dublin was delayed due to the activity of the Russian military aircraft in UK-controlled airspace,' the IAA said in a statement. 'The routing of one en route aircraft was changed to ensure that its track was sufficiently separated from the track of the two Russian military aircraft,' it added. Footage released on Russian TV shows the moment two RAF jets escort the Russian bomber last month . Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. The diverted and delayed planes were commercial jets 'carrying hundreds of people', the Irish Examiner newspaper reported. However, the IAA sad there had been 'no safety impact to civilian traffic in Irish controlled airspace'. The aircraft did not enter Irish sovereign airspace, but flew in Irish controlled airspace within 25 nautical miles (46.3 km) of the Irish coast between 3pm GMT and 7pm GMT, according to the authority. That incident came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth in January. British Defence Minister Michael Fallon warned that NATO needs to be ready for 'any kind of aggression from Russia' following the incident, which came after London summoned the Russian ambassador over a similar episode in January.

The gap between wage rises for young and older staff has widened significantly during the past five years, amid claims the over-50s are being left behind, official figures reveal. Critics said employers were cynically taking advantage of older workers who stay with the same company for longer by failing to train and promote them or give them decent annual pay rises. The under-25s saw their wages rise more than eight times faster than the over-50s, as they quickly climbed the rungs of the career ladder . Last year, workers aged 18 to 24 received bumper 10.6 per cent pay rises, falling to 3.8 per cent for people aged 25 to 34 and to 2 per cent for workers aged 36 to 49. For workers aged 50 to 64, pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent, official figures show ‚ significantly below the UK average of 2.1 per cent. The Office for National Statistics revealed in its latest Economic Review that the under-25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over-50. But while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently, official data shows that the gap is widening. In 2009, Britain's youngest workers received pay rises three times greater than older workers, but this has now widened to nine times greater. In the last three months of 2014, 5.4 per cent of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50-64-year-olds . Experts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff. Ros Altmann, a Whitehall adviser on older workers, said: 'Younger people's pay is rising faster than average and the rate of increase is accelerating. 'It could be because younger people are the most likely to receive training, with employers keen to focus on the newer workers and spending far less on training older workers. 'With the pace of change in technology and processes being so rapid nowadays, the need for ongoing training is more important than ever, so people do not fall behind in terms of pay and productivity.' Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, claiming the Tories 'believe in the old idea that as long as the rich and powerful are OK then everyone else will succeed' She also criticised the Government for subsidising training for under-25s, 'so that employers find it much cheaper to train youngsters than older workers'. She added: 'The increase in pay for younger workers is great news and shows they are progressing well. On the other hand, those who are in their later years seem less likely to be treated so generously and have not been able to enjoy the same kind of pay growth as younger colleagues.' Lisa Harris, at over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'Many older workers have spent years climbing the career ladder and are more likely to value the job satisfaction and security of doing the job they know well over the pursuit of more money. 'However, it's important that employers properly value the contribution and commitment of older workers and ensure they are fairly paid for the job they do and are not taken advantage of.'",128,247,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.",Young people in Britain are seeing their wages grow.

The stormy weather system, formed in the Tasman Sea, hasn't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever. East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter.

They can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain, causing flash flooding and riverine flooding. Climate specialist Don White from WeatherWatch told Daily Mail Australia: 'It forms occasionally, usually once a year. But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm.' 'This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one,' Mr White said. Scroll down for video .

'They normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24- 36 hours, which is unusually long for an East Coast Low.' East Coast Lows draw strong, moisture-laden winds across the coast, which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast. On Monday night 24 Sydney suburbs incurred 100mm of rainfall, with Blacktown hit hardest, thanks to the latest East Coast Low. An estimated 100,000 homes are without power on Tuesday morning across Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter region.

'We've had 24 hours of relentless gale-force winds. I haven't seen this wind damage for years,' Mr Pearce said. Some have speculated this week's East Coast Low will be the worst in five years, while meteorologist with Weatherzone Rob Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'This is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring.' 'The last major one that has affected Newcastle was in 2007. East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s,' Mr White said. Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast, causing this tree to fall on a car in East Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, on Monday with a driver and passenger inside.

In June 2007 bulk carrier Pasha Bulker ran aground near Newcastle amid wind gusts up to 124km/h. Other notable east coast lows occurred in October 2004, when there were mean wave heights off Sydney of 5m with a maximum height of about 10m. In August 1998, more than 300mm of rain fell over four days in Sydney and Illawarra, 420mm at Beaumont and 401mm at Kangaroo Valley. In May 1974, 165km/h gust at the Newcastle Nobbies saw bulk carrier the Sygna run aground. And in August 1857, the Dunbar wrecked at South Head killing 121, with only one person surviving.

It took 177 fire engines and 829 firefighters to bring the blaze under control, officials said . Residents are evacuated from their home in a village close to the fire at the chemical plant . The plant manufactures paraxylene, or PX, a chemical used for producing fibers and plastics. Exposure to the chemical can cause eye, nose and throat irritation. There have been several protests against the chemical plants in China in recent years. Authorities told The People's Daily Online that an oil leak at the plant had caught fire, leading to the explosion of three oil storage tanks at Tenglong Aromatic Hydrocarbon (Zhangzhou) Co.

The figure, which equates to £183 an hour, was paid by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. It represents double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged there were 47 agency nurses working at the trust in December last year. The trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid £2,200 to a temporary nurse for one 12-hour shift to help amid a shortage of trained nurses, a Freedom of Information request revealed (file picture) Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be aghast at the cost of just one shift. 'Agency nurses are far more expensive than their regular counterparts and we have to minimise the number used. 'You can't open a newspaper without hearing how tight finances are in the NHS, but the service has to become far more efficient with the money it already has.' Edmund Stubbs, from independent think tank Civitas, added: 'It is evident that a lack of staff is leading to excessive spending on agency staff, locums and overseas recruitment.' A spokesman for the trust said the £2,200 figure includes VAT, adding that the true figure paid to the nurse, including travel expenses, was £1,864. The shift covered was one in specialist Intensive Therapy Unit on a Bank Holiday. Defending their spending, Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She highlighted their situation is one shared by many hospitals across the UK. She added: 'We have said consistently that we want to recruit more nurses to reduce our reliance on agency and temporary staff and this has been widely publicised with a number of recruitment events taking place recently to attract new staff. 'We have recruited, or made offers to, more than 150 staff nurses and health care assistants in recent months as part of our efforts to recruit more nursing staff to support our wards and departments. Defending the spend Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at the trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She said in recent months the hospitals have recruited more than 150 nurses and healthcare assistants . 'These new recruits have included a number who have been offered positions through a successful nursing recruitment event at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital just last week, which we will repeat again on Thursday. 'We'll continue our efforts to ensure that over the coming months we will see fewer agency nurses on our wards as our new starters get settled in, which will mean better continuity of care and more support for ward teams.' Figures obtained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also revealed nearly a third of nursing recruits in the UK had to be sought abroad last year. NHS spending on temporary staff has rocketed to a staggering £2.5 billion a year because of a chronic shortage of British nurses. The number of foreign nurses and midwives registered in the past 12 months grew to 8,200, up from just 6,200 a year earlier. Around 7,500 came from the EU - particularly Spain, Italy and Portugal - with others came from further afield, including the Philippines.

Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride. Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child. Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there. They watched the announcement on television . ""That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,"" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch. ""I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy."" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's ""fight,"" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. ""I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood. That is the presupposition of the mindset,"" Lorenzo Lynch said. ""The dual system or the dual treatment."" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. ""I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,"" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. ""When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?"" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, ""I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been ""asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar."" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. ""I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,"" McCain said on the Senate floor. ""It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,"" McCain added. ""I thought he should be commended,"" Lorenzo Lynch said. ""I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point."" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle. For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate. For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would ""likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate."" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation. In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. ""Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense. It's past time. You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,"" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: ""While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. ""I think there is a much deeper analysis,"" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II. ""I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed."" ""Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,"" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders. He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it. He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.",175,162,"house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",The senate and congress are being irrational.

A first-half strike by the outstanding Aaron Ramsey was enough to see off Burnley at an intimidating Turf Moor and record an eighth win in a row by Arsene Wenger's side, the best run since The Invincibles team managed it in 2004. Arsenal have won at Sunderland, Newcastle, Manchester City and now Burnley, and picked up points at Liverpool and Everton, besides beating Manchester United in the FA Cup at Old Trafford.

CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . The new-found resolution, built on a base of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker at the back and Francis Coquelin holding in midfield, has enabled Arsenal to mount a surprising late run for the title. It is still unlikely given Chelsea are four points ahead and hold two games in hand. But should Jose Mourinho's men slip up in the first of them on Sunday at QPR, Arsenal will be waiting. After next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, The Gunners host Chelsea at The Emirates. Wenger seemed as pleased with his side's narrow win in Lancashire as he had done after dismantling Liverpool 4-1 at The Emirates the previous weekend. 'It was more of a fighting performance and many people question us on that side of things so I am pleased,' said the Arsenal manager, whose side also had to contend with a swirling wind in the first half. 'Coquelin contributes to the balance of the team. He can do things that other players aren't able to.' Burnley's Kieran Trippier (left) was unable to pull his side level with a 25-yard free-kick shortly after Ramsey's goal . Alexis Sanchez looks confused after a decision from referee Mike Dean as the Chilean star believes he was fouled . Mesut Ozil is surrounded by three Burnley players as the German star attacks inside Burnley's half . To pip his old enemy Mourinho, Wenger knows his side must equal the winning run of his last legendary title-winning team, and then go beyond it. 'We need a perfect run and we a need a non-perfect run from Chelsea. We can not master that, only our attitude. 'We have won 15 of the last 17 games so we are consistent. We want to keep winning of course. It is a challenge for the team.' An early goal always helps and Arsenal went ahead after 12 minutes. Mesut Ozil's shot was saved by Tom Heaton, Alexis Sanchez's rebound hit Michael Duff in the face and at the third time of asking Ramsey fired into the roof of the net for his ninth goal of the season. 'An awful goal to concede,' said Dyche, whose side are still in the bottom three but not without hope of beating the drop. Ramsey was the outsanding performer of the first half appearing to have almost limitless energy. One passage of play summed it up, one moment he was in the Arsenal wall blocking a David Jones free-kick, the next he was in the Burnley penalty area ready to try and score a second. Burnley clearly tried to rough Arsenal up a bit. Ben Mee and Michael Duff were booked, Ashley Barnes sent Hector Bellerin flying in the air. The home fans thought referee Mike Dean was being a bit soft towards the visitors but Wenger clearly didn't bear Burnley grudges, saying afterwards he hoped The Clarets would stay up. Gunners midfielder Santi Cazorla (left) is beaten by Burnley's Scott Airfield during the first 45 minutes . Sam Vokes and Laurent Koscielny take a tumble as the two sides battled it out on Saturday afternoon . Four thousand Arsenal fans were enjoying themselves and even had the temerity to sing ""This is a library"" as the normally voiceferous home support were stunned into temporarily silence. Arsenal's traditional soft-centre has hardened up too. Laurent Koscielny went crashing into Ashley Barnes when danger threatened though the Frenchman was relieved to see Ospina dive to his right to beat away Kieran Trippier's free-kick. Burnley left-back Ben Mee then became the game's first booking when he pushed his hand into Ramsey's face to stop the rampant No16. Santi Carzola then was close to scoring on his 100th Premier League appearance when he went close with a trademark free-kick. Among the watching spectators was Roy Hodgson though with Arsenal not having a single Englishman in their starting line-up, one hopes he made the journey north to check on Burnley's England under-21 striker Danny Ings. Arsenal ended the first half in control. Burnley's repeated fouling gave them a flurry of free-kicks and though the home crowd berated Mike Dean, it was difficult to see what else the official could have done.

Danny Ings goes close with an acrobatic effort which was easily saved by Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina . Ashley Barnes has a shot as Cazorla looks to block during a rare sight at goal for the Burnley striker . If Ramsey was the key man of the first half, Coquelin impressed in the second as Burnley belatedly chased an equaliser. He broke up most things but on the rare occasions he was breached, Burnley fluffed their lines in front of goal. Scotland international George Boyd, who scored a famous winner against Manchester City last month, miskicked when a cross from Ben Mee from the left found him in front of goal. England under-21 international Danny Ings then connected with an overhead kick that was saved by David Ospina with his bright orange kit in goal. At least the Ings effort was something for England manager Roy Hodgson to note down. He'd travelled to Lancashire to find Arsenal hadn't included a single Englishman in their starting line-up and Danny Welbeck was only given eight minutes at the end . Ospina also saved from Barnes while Welbeck missed a late chance to add to Arsenal's win when he shot wide from Mesut Ozil's pass.

It is something we have found all season,' said Dyche, who had some consolation by defeats earlier in the day for relegation rivals Hull City and Sunderland. Burnley have six matches left and among their fixtures are games against fellow strugglers Leicester City, Hull and Aston Villa. 'In the second half we got on the front foot, went right after them. And apart from the goal we conceded, I thought we defended really well. 'There wasn't a lot in the game and it was close against Manchester City and Chelsea too. Arsene would have spoken to his players about what to expect here. 'Make no mistake, they have a fine side. They are bringing on a Danny Welbeck as a £16million substitute, that's not bad. 'Now we have got six different kinds of games left, edgy games. There is a less expectation on us than other teams around us so we can play with a bit more freedom. There is a lot of belief from us going into those games. We want to be effective enough to win them.' David Jones looks to get the better of Sanchez during a difficult second half for the Gunners .

Victory over Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday enabled Brendan Rodgers' squad to set up a date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final next Sunday and Liverpool are hot favourites to reach the final. The final, against either Arsenal or Reading, will be staged on May 30 ‚ Gerrard's 35th birthday ‚ and has long been identified as being the perfect afternoon for Gerrard to bring the end down on his glittering Anfield career. Simon Mignolet (left) celebrates with Jordan Henderson after Liverpool reached the FA Cup semi-final . Philippe Coutinho (right) scored the winning goal in a tense 1-0 quarter-final victory against Blackburn . Captain Steven Gerrard, who is struggling to get in the side, will leave Anfield at the end of the season . It has created expectation and Liverpool have made heavy weather of getting to the semi-finals but Mignolet, who was outstanding in the 1-0 win at Ewood Park, maintains they are not thinking too far ahead. Gerrard, for one, won't let them get carried away. 'Nobody is talking about it,' said Mignolet. Stevie is the first one to acknowledge that. Before we speak about the final, we have got to get through the semi-final and that is only possible after getting through here. 'The only thing we can keep in mind now is how to get past Villa. Then we will see what comes. Villa will be tough. He is the first one to acknowledge that we can't have any extra pressure on the team (to give him the dream send-off). He won't let us think in a different way. Gerrard celebrates with Rafa Benitez after inspiring Liverpool to victory over West Ham in the 2006 Final . The Liverpool captain reacts after the Reds are beaten by Chelsea in the 2012 Final at Wembley . 'We just want to focus on Villa and the games before that. We have got something to look forward to and we want to make sure that we get to the final. That is what we said in the dressing room before the game and everyone did their jobs.' Liverpool last reached the FA Cup final in 2012, when they lost to Chelsea, and have not won the trophy since Gerrard inspired their 2006 victory over West Ham in Cardiff but they won't let that opportunity distract their ambitions in the Barclays Premier League. Though they have had their ambitions of finishing in the top four dented by back-to-back defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal, the picture could change once more this weekend if United win the Manchester derby and Liverpool beat Newcastle on Monday. Liverpool have seen their form slip in the league with consecutive defeats to Man United and Arsenal (above) 'We are pleased to get to the semi-final,' said Mignolet. 'Once it is semi-final time, we will make sure we are ready. But everything comes step by step. Newcastle is next. We are pleased with what we did against Blackburn but the next focus is the league. 'We will be ready and focused then to make sure we get to the final. The only thing we can do is focus and keep our heads down. We have got to keep doing the things we are doing. There is still a lot to play for. The only thing that we can do is take every game as it comes. 'When you are at Liverpool, you know you have to win every single game. After the results against Arsenal and Manchester United, we knew there was going to be criticism. You accept that. The only thing you can do is respond and we did that. Now the focus is on Newcastle.

Both pro-Russian rebels and government troops have been accused of concealing weapons from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) which could threaten the treaty. Under the agreement heavy artillery should have been pulled back from the front line, but just last week the opposing forces were seen to be breaking the deal. International observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) look at an armoured vehicle of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) The inspection by the international observers took place in 100km easts of Donetsk . Yesterday eye-witnesses saw two rebel controlled tanks pushing forward and days earlier Ukraine troops were seen transporting a tank and a large calibre gun close to the battlefront. In a bid to monitor the fragile ceasefire the OSCE has asked to know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored. Armed with cameras and clipboards the international observers have been driving around eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery. 'Some information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information,' said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman. It is unclear to what extent the OSCE teams are able to decide on their own where to inspect. The monitors are also regularly complaining that they are not being allowed to travel through Ukraine freely. Sometimes they are made to wait at checkpoints, forcing delays, while in more extreme cases they are blocked entirely from reaching their destination. Mr Bociurkiw said even a short wait violates the verification process. 'Any delays are unacceptable in our books,' he said. This week a group of inspectors travelled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border, to visit a cement factory in the rebel controlled territory. Here they scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers taking photographs and making notes. As they made there way back fresh tracks could be seen indictating that a convoy of heavy machinery had passed through while the inspectors were engaged elsewhere. In a bid to monitor the fragile ceasefire the OSCE has asked to know how many weapons each side has and where they are being store . Journalists in the Ukraine who followed the tracks found two tanks in a multi-vehicle convoy that included truck-pulled cannons and troop carriers full of rebel fighters. Two days earlier a Ukraine solider had boasted that a cease-fire busting cannon was being taken towards the front line. Ukrainian military officials have at times conceded that they are refraining from a complete withdrawal of heavy weapons, citing what they say is rebel reluctance to do the same. 'We will not withdraw all our weapons, as we have no confirmation that the same is being done by the enemy,' military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters earlier this month. 'It would be wrong and criminal to leave our troops without any cover.' Armed with cameras and clipboards that international observers have been driving around eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery . And Ukrainian authorities say artillery fire continues in sporadic clashes along the front line. Donetsk region police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said a resident of Avdiivka was killed yesterday after a shell struck a home in the town. In addition, neither side is willing to agree that tanks fall under the weapons to be withdrawn, although the cease-fire clearly envisions their removal.

307,3X66WABAJYKYCG7WKOVG3A3PVMR3GW,0e2c5d0587400565defcf2bdbaeef05297395014,"Tehran, Iran (CNN)Traveling to Iran these days, the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words: confident and optimistic. After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon. Businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted, and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy. ""Naturally we are all very happy,"" one woman in central Tehran told us. ""We expect better days economically and culturally. We want better relations with the rest of the world."" Another man added, ""I have a good feeling about it, because my country will be free of the fear of war."" But this weekend, just a few miles down the road, Iran's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual National Army Day parade. As the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other countries criticize Iran for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the Houthi rebels who have seized power in much of Yemen, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has praised the military as peacemakers for the Middle East. ""Today, our army is the source of our national stability,"" Rouhani said in his speech at the parade. ""And even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region."" The country's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with Western media outlets. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq. ""The unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live, and their right to freedom, dictates that all human society is threatened by ISIS, and all humans should unite against ISIS and work against them,"" Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi also repeated Iran's longstanding claim that the U.S. is partly responsible for creating ISIS, which now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. ""If the Americans really didn't create ISIS, and if they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,"" he said. ""But we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain. We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS."" Iran has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective, while praising its own strategy of training, advising, outfitting and directing Iraqi Shia militias, Kurdish forces and the Iraqi military. But in another apparent softening of rhetoric, a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between Iran and America will fade. ""At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,"" General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, told CNN. ""We would like the U.S. to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the U.S. military leadership,"" Pourdastan continued. ""We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat."" At the same time, Iran's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual ""Death to Israel, death to the U.S.A."" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade. The U.S. welcomes some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS, but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield. And for Iran's part, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also rejected direct coordination between the two long-time adversaries. And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical. In a recent televised speech, Khamenei said it was possible that there would be no deal by the June 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all. And Iran's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites. Meanwhile, the White House has been confronted by a Congress that is largely hostile to the negotiations, and has been making the case that a deal cannot be about trust, but about monitoring and verification. ""Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday. ""That's our main concern. And I think that goal, of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation, that goal can be met."" So far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week. But despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air, there is also fear that things could fall apart if Tehran and Washington aren't willing to make tough concessions.",162,39,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"US President, Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani should make serious concessions if they are really interested in taking the nuclear deal talks forward. Even as the White House has been witnessing a lot of opposition from the Congress to the next week's negotiations, the US has welcomed some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. It has to be seen whether the air of confidence and optimism will bring the two nations closer or if the talks will fail abruptly on account of both the governments refusing to relent.","As peacemakers for the middle east, Iranian military forces have come in for a lot of praise from their President Hassan Rouhani.

On Sunday, the New York Post's Page Six alleged that the marriage breakup was the result of Flay having an affair with his assistant Elyse Tirrel, who's 28. But the celebrity chef's business partner Laurence Kretchmer moved swiftly to dismiss the claims, saying that if Flay, 50, had been having an ongoing affair with an employee, he would know about it. Scroll down for video . The other woman? It was alleged Sunday that chef Bobby Flay has been having an affair with his assistant Eliyse Tirrell and that it led to the breakdown of his marriage to Stephanie March . Secret affair: Page Six claimed Flay, 50, has been seeing Tirrel, who's 28, for three years and that according to a friend of March, the actress learned of the relationship with the former hostess just after Thanksgiving 2014 . Page Six reported that Tirrell is a 'singer/actress who worked as a hostess at the chef's Bar Americain in 2008 and became his assistant.' The gossip site claimed that Flay, who filed for divorce from March, 40, in April, has been cheating on the Law & Order:SUV star for three years with Tirrell. March's friend Maia Madison, a writer and actress, told Page Six that March arrived 'sobbing uncontrollably' at her home just after Thanksgiving after finding out about the affair. Madision went on to say that Tirrell 'is about to become the Monica Lewinsky of the food world.' Messy divorce: Flay filed for divorce earlier this month saying that his 10-year marriage to Law & Order: SVU star March has 'irretrievably broken down' After the story ran, Flay's representative released a statement to the media saying: 'We will continue to refrain from responding to the continued efforts by certain parties to spread rumors and innuendo.' 'This specific allegation was in a letter sent from one attorney in this case to the other. It was written and then leaked specifically to try to insert this story into the press, and that's unfortunate.' The statement continued:: 'Even more unfortunate is that all of this is being done in order to renegotiate a prenuptial agreement that was agreed to over a decade ago and never amended during the marriage.' Kretchmer defended his friend and insisted that none of the claims about an affair with his assistant are based in reality. He is quoted as saying that the young woman is' a great and valued employee.' 'If she had an affair with Bobby it would have been reported to me. That has never even been suggested, and people like to talk,' Kretchmar said. 'Have Bobby and Elyse been seen together? Yes, that's her job.' He then suggested that there is more mud-slinging to come in the ugly battle between the former couple whom he has known for 14 years. 'As ugly as Stephanie is going to look [when this news comes out], she will look uglier when other things come out,' Kretchmer told Page Six. Bitter battle: March, 40, is contesting the prenuptial agreement the couple signed ahead of their marriage that means the famous chef, who's worth about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 a month in alimony . The Food Network chef filed court documents filed on April 10 saying that his 10-year marriage has 'irretrievably broken down.' The actress, though, has mounted a legal challenge to the prenuptial agreement that the now estranged couple signed which says Flay, reported to be wort about $20 million, only has to pay her $5,000 per month. In return, March has accused the chef of 'bullying through economic warfare.' March's lawyer said the famous chef won't let her and her sick mother Laura Derby stay in their $8m marital Manhattan home unless she signs a press release alleging their split was amicable.

Figures released by analysts Deloitte show that the 20 clubs' annual figures combined show a pre-tax profit for the first time since 1998/99 - to the tune of £190m in 2013/14. Premier League revenues have risen 29 per cent from £2.5billion to £3.3billion due to the increase in the value of the TV deals, but wages have grown by just six per cent in the same period - £1.8billion to £1.9billion overall. Juan Mata scores an audacious goal against Liverpool at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday . Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: 'Last season was the first in the Premier League's current three-year broadcast deal, which was a record-breaker when it was struck. 'Combined with strong commercial growth at the highest revenue generating clubs, this has boosted Premier League revenue 29 per cent to a record £3.3bn. However, despite this extra income clubs showed relative restraint in wage costs, which grew by 6 per cent to £1.9bn. 'In the first year of the preceding two broadcast deals, 56 per cent and 81 cent of respective revenue growth was absorbed by wage costs. This time it is less than 20 per cent.' The figures will provide good news for the 20 club chairmen who meet in London on Thursday - where they will also face a protest organised by the Football Supporters' Federation calling on the top flight to use the increase in TV income to cut ticket prices and funnel more money to the lower leagues and grass-roots. FA chairman Greg Dyke's wants to increase home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 . The protestors are expected to be allowed to send in a letter to the chairmen, who are also expected to take a significant decision on the administration of the Premier League. Richard Scudamore, the current chief executive, may be appointed as executive chairman with a possible re-organisation of the board. FA chairman Greg Dyke's plans to increase home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 are not on the agenda but may be discussed. It is understood there is little appetite at the Premier League to change the quotas - not least because it would mean the English clubs being put at a disadvantage compared to the rest of Europe.",110,152,"billion, figures, economy, global, growth, economic, number, countries, numbers, expected,","united, manchester, liverpool, chelsea, league, premier, city, manager, ferguson, striker,","economic growth, global growth, billion dollar figures, economy is growing, expected growth","Manchester United's manager, Premier League, the striker for the team, Liverpool versus Chelsea",This topic is about economic growth involving billion dollar figures showing that the economy is growing as expected globally.,"This topic is about Manchester United's manager, Premier League, the striker for the team, and Liverpool versus Chelsea.",The Premier League id turning a profit for the first time in 15 years.

Scott Walker for his promised signature. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. It was a straight party-line vote, with no Democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday. 'Today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in Wisconsin,' Democratic Rep. Terese Berceau, of Madison, said minutes before the vote. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday . Mary Will, left, with Local 68, and Corey Smith, right, with Local 113, chant 'Union Strong' during a rally inside the Wisconsin State Capitol as the state Assembly debates the right-to-work bill in Madison, Wisconsin on Thursday. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 on Friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate . Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on Friday. The bill passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support and all Democrats against. The Senate passed it last week . The proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who aren't in a union to pay dues. Supporters argued it would make Wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand. But opponents said the goal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat, and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces, in turn hurting the economy. Twenty-four other states have right-to-work laws. Michigan and Indiana were the two most recent states to enact it, both in 2012. The protests from unions in Wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when Walker and Republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions, growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011. And only a handful of protesters were on hand for Friday's deliberations. Two people were arrested Thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities, a spokesman for Walker's administration said. The vote came after Walker said in September, during his re-election campaign, that right-to-work was not a priority and wouldn't come up this session. Walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers . Legislative leaders, including Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also said right-to-work would not be debated. But two weeks ago, when Senate Republicans said they were going forward with it, Walker said he would sign it . Pointing out that 'the bill would be dead if he opposed' it, Arnold Shober, a political science professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, told TPM last week that Walker had to side with his party on the issue. 'He knows that it will court controversy, but he cannot afford to lose potential GOP primary voters,' Shober said. A protester chants outside of the Assembly chamber during debate on right-to-work legislation at the State Capitol on Thursday. Opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat . Opponents of the Wisconsin legislature's 'right-to-work' measure rallied at the state Capitol last Saturday. The proposal, due to be signed next week by Walker, would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers . 'Legislative leaders know this, and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable.' Walker is scheduled to be in Iowa for an agriculture summit on Saturday that's attracting other likely Republican presidential candidates. The Wisconsin executive's well-established intentions to compete for the Oval Oval next year had state Democrats accusing their Republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help Walker's likely presidential campaign, even though Walker had said he didn't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics. They called on Walker to veto the bill. 'It's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor's ambitions,' said Democratic Rep. Cory Mason of Racine. Vos accused Democrats of having 'Walker derangement syndrome,' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues. 'I'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom,' said Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt of Fond du Lac. 'I'm going to use it over and over again because that's what this is about.' Democratic Rep. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, and a member of AFSCME, said she cares about people more than freedom. 'It just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people's everyday lives and we don't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive,' Johnson said. 'This bill is a bunch of crap.' The national campaign arm of state Democrats, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that 'Wisconsin Republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women.' It called on Wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their 'right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state's middle class.' A crowd protests outside the Wisconsin Senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week. The group much smaller than the one in 2011 against Walker's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out. Still, the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people . 'Instead of addressing the real problems facing Wisconsin,' DLCC Executive Director Michael Sargeant said, citing a $2.2 billion budget deficit, 'Republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages, interferes with the operations of private companies, and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in Scott Walker's Wisconsin since he took office.' Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $7 million to defend Walker after the 2011 spat with unions said Friday afternoon that 'every American deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues, just as they have the right to join a union if they choose.' 'We're pleased that Wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom,' AFP Chief Operating Officer Luke Hilgemann said in a statement. AFP-Wisconsin State Director David Fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is 'excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs.' 'No longer will the Badger State's employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment,' he said and thanked the organization's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers, calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign.",113,175,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","The 'right-to-work' legislation bill for Wisconsin after being pushed through a fast track process for the signature of the governor Scott Walker was passed by the Assemble after 20 hour long debate.

TO their response, the national campaign Arm of state Democrats, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee issued a statement criticizing the Republicans for their attack on Unions and general public.

Wu Hsia, 21, had broken up with long-term girlfriend Jun Tang, 20, after meeting new love Rong Tsao, 22, in the city of Ningbo in eastern China's Zhejiang province. But Jun had taken the split badly and, over the following three months, engaged in a campaign of harassment in an effort to make her beau leave his new girlfriend. Saved: Jun Tang - the ex-girlfriend - emerges from the river covered in mud alongside Wu Hsia's brother . Fed up with the grief he was getting from both sides, People's Daily Online reports that Wu arranged to meet both women at a local beauty spot to clear the air and make it clear where his loyalties lie. But Jun forced the issue by throwing herself into the river - and Rong quickly followed suit. The incident echoed a common Chinese custom that revolves around men being asked who they would rescue if their mother and their lover both jumped in a river. Wu said: 'I was sick of being nagged from both sides. 'Rong was moaning about Jun and Jun was moaning about her and it all go too much.' Ultimatum: Jun had jumped in the river in the hope her ex-boyfriend would save her . Muddy: But he chose his current girlfriend, leaving Jun to be rescued by his brother and fire services . But when they got to the river, the situation went from bad to worse. A police spokesman said: 'The girls began arguing and the man's ex-girlfriend felt insulted by a comment made by the new girlfriend, and so she jumped into the river calling for her former lover to save her. 'The new girlfriend, fearing that he might indeed jump in to save his ex-lover, then jumped in as well and both of them within calling for him to rescue them from drowning.' Wu settled the matter by jumping in the water to save his current girlfriend, ringing his brother to ask for help in pulling out the ex. According to a firefighter who attended the incident, Jun - stuck up to her waist in mud - calmly rang a friend at this point to tell her she was stuck in the river. The friend then rang emergency services. The fireman said: 'We found a woman mired to her chest in mud - about 20 meters away from the riverbank.' Rescuers were forced to tie a rope round Jun to haul her out of the mud. Judging by the brief conversation Wu and his ex had after the rescue, his problems may not be over. According to the fireman, Wu said to her: 'We broke up 4 months ago. Why you still bother me?' She replied: 'I want to bother you.' Current girlfriend Rong required hospital treatment for minor injuries after hitting a boat as she jumped into the river. The story quickly went viral in China, where there is a chronic shortage of single women because the country's one-child policy meant parents preferred male babies.

Some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in February with a collective value of £6.2billion . Meanwhile, in further signs of growing consumer confidence, the annual growth in people's borrowing on personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008, at 4.4 per cent. The BBA also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in February, which could be partly due to the popularity of the Government's recently-launched, market-beating 'pensioner bonds'. Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: 'The increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve. 'We're seeing stronger demand for mortgages as consumers take advantage of some of the very competitive deals currently available. 'Demand for loans and other types of personal borrowing is rising at its fastest rate since the financial crisis. Consumers are feeling increasingly confident about buying big ticket items, such as cars or home improvements, as the recovery really begins to take hold. The British Bankers' Association (BBA) have said the increase is 'welcome news' 'Personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive, particularly the new pensioner bond.' Lending to non-financial companies fell by £200million, with growth in manufacturing, transport, storage and communication offset by net repayments from the construction, accommodation and food services and the wholesale and retail sectors, the BBA said. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The recovery in mortgage lending reflects a very favourable economic backdrop. 'Mortgage rates are at record lows, and fewer households now expect a rise in rates within the next year. The reform to stamp duty has also increased most buyers' purchasing power. And that boost to affordability has been accompanied by further improvements in the labour market. 'Real earnings are finally rising, unemployment is falling, and the employment rate has reached record highs. That should all act to boost the mortgage market.' Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the BBA's mortgage figures reinforce his belief 'that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014'. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said low mortgage rates are likely to be around for a while yet. He said that with Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation at 0 per cent, a rise in the Bank of England base rate from its current 0.5 per cent level this year is 'highly unlikely and could even have been pushed back for 18 months to two years'. Mr Harris said: ''The good news for borrowers is that rates are likely to be very competitive over (the) coming months.'",247,128,"tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.",The article talked about how the market rate for home buyers have gone down.

Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak . In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed . The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal.

The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the delay on the attorney general post reflected 'inept leadership,' not a flaw in the trafficking bill, and that the move suggested the White House could no longer trust congressional Republicans to act in good faith. The spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the White House and GOP leaders after November's elections, when Republicans were swept into control of Congress, has since soured and is now curdling. Scroll down for video . UNCONSCIONABLE: White House spokesman Josh Earnest blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying the delay calls into question the Kentucky lawmaker's leadership abilities . The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate finishes a once bipartisan human trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions . Battling for control of the federal government with the executive branch, the first few months of the GOP's reign over the legislative branch has been marked by constant bickering with the White House and numerous veto threats. In an attempt to balance what they saw as executive overreach on the part of the president, who in November took unilateral action to save millions of illegal immigrants from deportation against the wishes of Republicans in Congress, the GOP last month attempted to hold captive funding for the Homeland Security department. The majority party ended up with egg on its face, though, when it opted to back down from the fight and appropriate money to the department rather than watching it to go into shut down mode until Democrats backed a measure to defund Obama's immigration directives - a scenario that may have never come about. House Republicans in January also stuck their finger in the eye of the Obama administration when Boehner secretly invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Usually, the executive branch coordinates visits with foreign heads of state. More recently, Senate Republicans wrote a letter to Iranian leaders cautioning them that a nuclear pact with the current administration may not last. The missive could undermine the tenuous negotiations the U.S. and its allies are in with the Middle Eastern country. McConnell is now using the Lynch confirmation vote as a bargaining chip in his fight to keep a provision that would place heavy restrictions on use of money for abortion in a victims fund named in the child sex trafficking bill. Democrats had already signed off on the legislation in committee before they realized that the measure was included. They have since backed away from the bill as is and accused Republicans of trying to hoodwink them, despite having had weeks to read the legislation in full before a final vote. 'If they want to have time to turn to the attorney general bill next week, we need to finish up this human trafficking bill,' McConnell said Sunday on CNN. Earnest at one point suggested that McConnell, pictured here last week at a press conferene on Captiol Hill with other Senate Republicans, is 'inept' as a leader . Obama's spokesman lit into McConnell on Monday over the play. 'You've got to hand it to Republicans, that they've taken even a measure as common sense as that and turned it into a partisan controversy,' Obama's spokesman said today. 'The fact that leader McConnell can't build bipartisan support for a child sex-trafficking bill, I think, is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start. Earnest at another point suggested that McConnell is 'inept,' The GOP leader, he said, should just take out the offending abortion measure in order to get Democrats back on board. 'I don't really understand,' he said, why the majority leader doesn't look at this situation and say, 'Let's remove the objection so we can get it passed, and get it signed into law.' Although the White House frequently threatens to veto pending bills unpalatable to Obama, Earnest wouldn't say whether Obama would sign the bill with the abortion language included. He suggested the issue is moot because Republicans don't have enough support to pass it anyway. In a sharp rebuke, the White House appeared to question whether Obama can trust McConnell and his fellow GOP leaders and 'whether their word is good with the president.' Earnest pointed out that McConnell had argued last year that Lynch's confirmation should wait until the new GOP-run Senate was seated in January, but was now claiming publicly that it was Democrats who prolonged the confirmation by waiting until 2015. The White House spokesman said he is often asked if McConnell 'is a man of his word.' This incident is not 'a very good sign of faith,' Earnest proclaimed. Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder, pictured here to the left of the president. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid chimed in on Monday and said that McConnell 'gave his word' that Lynch would receive fair consideration. 'Now he's hedging on that,' Reid said during a speech on the Senate floor. 'Republicans simply can't govern,' Reid, the Senate's majority leader until Republican took over in January, argued. McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart blamed the trafficking bill kerfuffle on Democrats in a statement provided to the Associated Press. And given White House's hesitancy to issue a veto, he said, the president, not McConnell, should ask his party members to swallow a version of the bill it doesn't entirely agree with. 'They need to choose between a partisan filibuster and the pleas of thousands of abused children across the country,' Stewart said. 'And they need to do it soon.' Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder.

Both men needed the comfort of big runs, Cook having been axed from the one-day side on the eve of the World Cup and Trott on his first England appearance since November 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety. He now has the chance to nail down the role of Cook's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances. 'Trotty and Cooky gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the Test matches,' said Stokes. Ben Stokes spoke strongly about his team-mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease . Stokes had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball, as England dominated the day . 'The biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle. You can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today. Trotty has been great, it is almost like he hasn't left. To see him go out and score some runs, the way he has been known to for England over the last five years, was really good to see.' Stokes arguably went over the top in his assessment of Cook's knock, but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores, it could yet prove an important effort. Stokes described his captain Cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form . 'It was fantastic for Cooky too,' said Stokes. 'He's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world, like he once was, was great. The tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away, which was good to see.' For his part, Stokes looks a certainty to return to the Test side in the Caribbean. Having announced himself as an all-rounder of unusual promise in the 2013-14 Ashes, he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year. He did not even make the cut for the World Cup but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form. Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . 'It was nice to make an impact back in the first game, even if it was just a warm-up game in an England shirt,' he said. 'I still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well. 'I'm still working very hard on getting back into the team, which is what I want to do. Hopefully that is just the start. 'I need performances to back that up. To keep my place I know I need to keep performing, which is something I haven't been consistent with since Australia so hopefully I get a chance in the Test matches here and I can build on that.'",217,180,"club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","goal, win, side, scored, minutes, goals, half, barcelona, points, match,","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","scored a goal, winning the match by a few points, scored before half-time, barcelona has minutes left","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.","This topic is about winning the match by a few points, and how Barcelona had minutes left and had scored before half-time but were able to score a goal at the end.","This article was discussing a European ""football"" match.

Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could miss the remainder of the season with a groin injury .

'And then I had her in the back of the ambulance on the side of the road, somewhere. I don't know where,' Cherry said. Advice on the website www.babycenter.com suggests that it's generally safe to fly during the third trimester, but expectant mothers should discuss plans with a doctor or midwife before booking a flight.

But it was also yet another pave stone in the long path of violence between Kenya and the Somali militants. To understand Thursday's attack, one must understand this: Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war. Although al Qaeda was behind the 1998 attack that killed more than 200 people, Al-Shabaab has killed many more Kenyans and is by far the country's most persistent tormenter, according to a University of Maryland study. Their attacks have notched up since 2008. And in October 2011, Kenya Defense Forces invaded Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based, with the crushing Operation Linda Nchi, Swahili for ""Protect the Country."" Thus began a bloody vicious cycle, with Al-Shabaab retaliating on Kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings. Here are some of the most heinous attacks on Kenya by the Somali terrorist group. Early Thursday, while many students still slept, at least four gunman burst into a Christian prayer service at Garissa University College, leading into Easter Weekend. They shot students and took hostages, whom they herded across campus. As they encountered students, they separated them into Muslims and Christians. They spared the former, eyewitness Joel Ayora said. They killed the latter. Kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from Somalia's southern border. They killed four gunman, but not before 147 victims were shot dead. In December, Al-Shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the Somali border. They shot Christian workers dead, and spared their Muslim colleagues. Red Cross Workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry. It was eye-for-an-eye retaliation, the militants said, for raids Kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists. Parallel to Operation Linda Nchi, Kenya has gone after ethnic Somalis within their own borders triggering protest by Human Rights Watch, which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment. In a 2011 case, Kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic Somalis in Garissa and let them sit in the mud, while beating some of them, HRW alleged. Passengers on a bus in Kenya's north were told to recite from the Quran or die in November 2014. Shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed Mandera, near Somalia's border, Al-Shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in. Those who failed to recite verses were gunned down, leaving 28 dead. In its claim of responsibility, Al-Shabaab said the dead were Christians, and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by Kenyans. A day after the attack, Kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into Somalia. They claimed to kill 100 Al-Shabaab militants. In July, Al-Shabaab gunmen opened fire on the Lamu coast, a popular tourist region, and at a police station in a neighboring county. They killed 22 people. Last May, tour companies evacuated vacationers from Kenya after the UK and United States issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks. Before the Garissa massacre, the Westgate Mall attack was the deepest wound Al-Shabaab had inflicted on Kenya. For four days, four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital Nairobi into a cauldron of blood, smoke and rubble. Part of the mall collapsed as Kenyan security forces fought for control. At least 61 civilians were killed, as well as a handful of security officers. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya participation in Africa Union military operations in Somalia. Even with Al-Shabaab's shooting in Garissa, al Qaeda's bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest Islamist terror attack on Kenyan soil. In short succession, bombs detonated at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania back then. The Nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at Dar es Salaam. Al Qaeda founding member Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a New York jail, where he still awaits trial. He is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye.",64,129,"group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","attack, attacks, killed, attacked, bomb, people, explosion, bombing, injured, blast,","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","bomb explosion attack, killed in a bombing attack, injured in the blast, the explosion was caused by a bomb, people behind the attack, car bomb killed and wounded people","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","This topic is about a bomb explosion attack, people killed in a bombing attack, or injured in the blast, an explosion caused by a bomb, people behind the attack, a car bombing killing and wounding people.",Al-shabaab is main militant group in Kenya.

David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are 'immoral' as millions receive a tax cut. As 14million working households ‚ more than nine in ten ‚ are given an average boost of £200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money ‚ because they 'know best' how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on 'bureaucracy' and 'crackpot Government schemes'. 'There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers' money,' he will say. 'And we believe it's people ‚ not politicians ‚ who know best how to spend their own money. And that's what today is all about.' He will add that it is 'wrong ‚ frankly immoral ‚ for Government to spend money like it grows on trees'. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub 'money back Monday', are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households ‚ more than nine in ten ‚ will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a 'better and fairer place to live', adding that low taxes 'go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. 'For me, there's the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. 'There's the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. 'But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong ‚ frankly immoral ‚ for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.' He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit 'without reaching into working people's pockets like Labour would'. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: 'David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they've never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? 'The truth is millions are worse off because of this government's choices. 'And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: 'In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people.

Now you can, thanks to a new app that calculates a slimmer version of yourself - without having to do any exercise. 'Visualize You' processes an image of you to reveal what you'd look like if you were thinner - and perhaps inspire you to achieve your weight loss goal. Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app called Visualize You. It calculates what you would look like if you lost a specified amount weight. Shown on the left is TV star James Corden at his current weight, 210lbs (95kg), and on the right he is seen after digitally losing 60lbs (27kg) A picture of Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy at an event in February is shown on the left, and on the right the star is seen after digitally losing 50lbs (23lbs) Users are shown an original and a slimmer version, with a slider, so they can compare how they would look before and after losing weight. The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps which stretch or pinch images. The app has been developed with the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Centre, and UnitedHealthcare. Actor Jonah Hill, pictured in June 2014, is seen on the left at his normal weight, and on the right he is shown with a digital weight loss of 60lbs (27lbs) It asks you to enter your current height and weight and your target weight, giving you flexibility over how ambitious you want to be. Weight loss specialist Dr Charlie Seltzer told Yahoo Health: 'Visual cues are very helpful for a lot of people. 'I will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like, provided the body image is healthy. 'l'd hate for someone to put [their photo] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look, and get discouraged and disgruntled that they're not changing how they're supposed to. 'But my first thought upon hearing about this app, was: ""It sounds like a really good idea.""' Charlie Lankston (lost 20lbs/9kg) Charlie Lankston is seen here before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 20lbs (9kg) 'At first, I thought it was great. The ""after"" picture looks pretty realistic, which I wasn't actually expecting, and it was amazing to see what I could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym! 'However, after thinking about it a bit more, I started feeling a slightly ashamed about the size of my actual face. 'Realistically, losing 20lbs is actually a pretty tough task, and the likelihood that I'll be able to achieve it - and attain my ""skinny face"" - any time soon is pretty ""slim"" which doesn't make me feel too great. 'Looks like it's time to hit the treadmill‚¶' Erica Tempesta (lost 38lbs/17kg) Erica Tempesta is seen here before before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg . 'It was cool to see such a dramatic difference, but I feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face, which isn't necessarily how I would look nearly 40lbs lighter. 'My face has always been oval, regardless of my size. The app just made my face look longer as if my cheeks were sucked in. 'I chose a somewhat unrealistic target weight, but it was the size I had been in high school, so based on past pictures, I already had an idea of what my face should have looked like with less weight. 'I personally didn't think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss.' The app allows you to take or upload a photo. You then need to enter your current height and weight, and then also enter your target weight. It will then enable you to 'scroll' through various weights on your way to your target, to see what you would look like .

Visualize You is effectively a reverse version of the popular app 'Fat Booth' in which users were able to see what they looked like if they were overweight. Fat Booth was launched in 2010 and has been downloaded 35,000,000 times, earning its creators an estimated £16 million ($24 million). Opticians and fashion retailers have made use of similar technology to let users virtually try on glasses on their websites. Dr Michael Roizen, Chairman of Wellness at the Cleveland Clinic, said: 'Visualize You is a major step forward in helping people approach weight loss in a more informed, educated and fun manner.' Dr Holly Wyatt, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center added: 'The app offers individuals a clear-cut end goal for weight loss and provides [users] with an important tool to activate and achieve a successful programme.'

The German discounter has won an increasing share of the market since the recession as cash-strapped families look for cheaper alternatives. It now lags behind only the 'big four' ‚ Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons ‚ and the Co-operative. Growth: Discount chain Aldi now has a bigger market share than upmarket supermarket Waitrose . Major supermarkets have slashed prices in recent months to fend off competition from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite this Aldi has lifted its market share from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the past three months. Waitrose has 5.1 per cent of the market, up from 5 per cent, according to consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Lidl claimed recently that Britain's middle classes had become the 'Lidl Classes' after sales rose by a fifth in a year. But while Lidl remains eighth behind Waitrose, Aldi is now one of Britain's mainstream supermarkets. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. This compares to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose, lifting its share of the market. The total market share of the 'big four' fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Aldi ‚ motto Spend a little. Live a lot ‚ stocks virtually all own-branded goods and offers a far smaller selection of goods. By contrast middle-class rival Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, focuses on customer service and high-quality produce.

Aldi has 560 stores and hopes to double in size by 2022. Yesterday, it announced it was opening nine more stores in London, creating up to 600 jobs. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco's dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent. But Fraser McKevitt, at Kantar Worldpanel, said the success of Aldi and Lidl meant the entire structure of the 'supermarket landscape' was changing. The price war between upmarket retailers and discounters has led to significantly cheaper food. The Office for National Statistics says food prices fell by more than 3 per cent in February compared to a year earlier.

The former Secretary of State gave details of her daughter's pregnancy in a new Epilogue for her memoir, Hard Choices, released just days before she is expected to announce her presidential run. In the new chapter, shared by the Huffington Post on Friday, she suggested that the birth of her granddaughter made her think about the future of all children and had motivated her political plans. She explained how in 2014, she and her husband got the 'wonderful news' that their daughter Chelsea and her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky were expecting a baby. Doting: Hillary Clinton, pictured with her husband Bill and their granddaughter Charlotte after her birth last year, has said the baby girl has made her realize she has much more work to do . Hillary Clinton was 'unabashedly giddy' at the news, she said. 'As the summer slipped away, I drove Chelsea crazy checking in practically every hour,' she wrote. 'How are you feeling? Any news from the doctor? When's it going to happen!' But, whereas she and Bill had been disorganized ahead of the birth of Chelsea, their daughter was far calmer and better prepared, she wrote. 'I remember how frazzled [Bill] was when it was finally time to go to the hospital,' she recalled of her own labor. 'Lamaze recommended bringing a small plastic bag of ice to suck on during labor. Bill ended up bringing enough to fill a thirty-nine-gallon garbage bag. It was quite a sight. 'By comparison, Chelsea and Marc were much more organized and prepared.' In September, Chelsea started going into labor in New York City, so they headed to the hospital to greet their first grandchild - Charlotte Clinton Mezvinksy, who was born on September 26. 'Chelsea emerged, exhausted but glowing,' she wrote. 'All our pent up nervous energy burst out in laughter and excited whoops, more like a couple of kids than the newly-minted grandparents we had suddenly become. 'After a while, Bill and I stepped out into the hallway to let them rest. We sat quietly, holding hands, trying to process the rush of emotions. I looked over and saw a tear in Bill's eye.' Calm: In a new chapter of her book, Hillary Clinton said her daughter Chelsea and son-in-law Marc Mezvinksy were far more organized and relaxed about the birth of baby Charlotte than she was about Chelsea . Proud: She revealed that she saw tears in her husband's eyes after the birth of baby Charlotte at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, pictured, last September. She is the couple's first granddaughter . She explained that while she had been nervous about giving birth to Chelsea and the impending responsibility, 'as a new grandmother... there is nothing but joy'. 'It's probably the world's best job,' she wrote. 'I love every minute of it.' She added that even though she has a terrible singing voice - so terrible that an 18-month-old Chelsea told her to stop singing to her - she enjoys singing lullabies to baby Charlotte. 'Charlotte has yet to complain,' she wrote. Welcoming her granddaughter has made her want to make the world a better place for Charlotte and other children, she wrote in the epilogue - hinting that she will be back in politics soon. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she wrote. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' Nervous: She said that before the birth of Chelsea, pictured together in the 1980s, she had been so nervous about being a mother but that now she finds being a grandmother is pure joy . She went on: 'In just a few months, Charlotte had already helped me see the world in new ways. There was so much more to do.' Earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said his granddaughter has changed his outlook in politics too - although it's had the opposite effect. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody,' he told Town & Country magazine. 'I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' It followed reports that Hillary has rented space for her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. According to reports on Friday, she will announce her bid to run for president on Sunday before immediately traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with voters.",113,115,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","Hillary Clinton, former secretary of State, shares her joy of becoming grand mother in her new epilogue.

Hillary feels that giving more values to your family will have huge impact on political campaigns and can help in improvising state functioning for betterment of future kids.","Hillary Clinton's daughter Chelsea gave birth to Baby Charlotte.

Cousins smiled as he left Fremantle Magistrates Court, despite the magistrate labelling him 'a risk to the public' and warning him that he now faces a jail term for the 'serious' offences he has committed. 'It doesn't matter if you're Mother Theresa or Jack the Ripper,' Magistrate Steven Malley told Cousins in court on Thursday, according to ABC News. 'You commit those offences and the legislation says you have to go to jail. 'I accept you have issues but I cannot allow the public to be put at risk.' Scroll down for video . Former AFL star Ben Cousins is handcuffed as he arrives at court on Thursday, 24 hours after failing to face a magistrate over driving charges . With a smirk on his face Ben Cousins, a former AFL player, leaves Perth's Fremantle Court on Thursday . Cousins handed himself in to police after failing to make a court appearance over traffic charges . Cousins was supposed to appear in court to face reckless driving charges on Wednesday morning but he failed to show up. His lawyer Adain Craus represented him during the session and claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments. The magistrate had ordered Cousins to produce written evidence of the conflicting appointments before 4pm WST or an arrest warrant would be issued. The arrest warrant was issued and on Thursday morning the former AFL star, Perth-based Cousins surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station. There are reports he is likely to face court later on Thursday . The 2005 Brownlow medallist was arrested on March 11 after allegedly leading police on a low speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park. When Cousins finally appeared in court, Magistrate Malley told Cousins his decision not to front up was the wrong one, ascertaining Cousins had followed the 'unwise' advice of his lawyer, Mr Craus. 'When you're on bail you're under an obligation to appear, unless you're strapped to a bed on a drip,' Magistrate Malley said in court. Magistrate Malley pointed out that there was no legitimate conflict of appointment as court had been scheduled for a 10am start, whilst Cousins' appointment was not until midday. The court session would only have lasted a matter of minutes, leading the Magistrate to assume Cousins had been advised not to appear in court by Mr Craus. Cousins had been on bail and was supposed to appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning but he failed to show up . His lawyer claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments . Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has made headlines several times in the past fortnight after a string of alleged incidents . He was arrested on March 11 after police saw him driving erratically in Bicton and was eventually caught several suburbs away in Mosman Park . He was charged with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test. Cousins has twice been hospitalised for mental health assessments following that incvident - the first time after he breached security at an SAS base in Swanbourne. The second time followed seemingly bizarre behaviour in Canning Vale, including climbing on the roof of a house. The former West Coast Eagles captain has not been charged over those incidents.

The group, who posted the performance video to Facebook and Youtube, explained that they composed the tune after experiencing a 'lack of respect shown by Ryanair flight attendants.' In the video, the band's lead singer strums a ukulele as the group serenades passengers on board - despite Ryanair's scathing review of the sarcastic ditty. A well-known Spanish band from Catalonia, called Sidonie, sang an impromptu song aboard a Ryanair flight . While en route to Santiago, the band grew impatient with the alleged 'lack of respect' from flight attendants . Although sung in their native tongue, the lyrics read: 'Ryanair, how we like Ryanair, and its flight attendants, they could not be nicer'. Clearly meant to be ironic, some passengers even join in and sing or clap along as the band repeats the chorus during their impromptu performance. Explaining the motivation behind their hilarious video, the band wrote online: 'After receiving, repeatedly, the habitual lack of respect shown by flight attendants on the Ryanair route to Santiago, we were moved to compose and perform a song dedicated to them and their irritable airline.' Ryanair, however, wasn't as impressed with the band's performance. Robin Kiely, a spokesperson for the airline told MailOnline Travel: 'Sidonie? More like sit down mate. 'The lyrics are average, the vocals out of tune, the ukulele playing leaves a lot to be desired and there isn't one trumpet.' Taking matters into their own hands, the group composed and performed a tongue-in-cheek tune . As they paraded up and down the aisle of the plane, some passengers even began to sing along with the lyrics . The band also posted the video to Facebook, adding that the song was dedicated to the 'irritable airline' 'We much prefer our new on-time landing music, which will be heard on over 90 per cent of our flights this year, as we carry 100 million customers,' Kiely added. Ryanair is famous for complaints about its customer service and surcharges, and it has recently launched a marketing campaign and measures such as allocated seating to win over passengers.

The appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the Phantom of the Emirates, one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an Arsenal shirt in the modern era. It's true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for Arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have. Cesc Fabregas was booed by large portions of the Arsenal supporters upon his return to the Emirates . Fabregas was cheered - albeit sarcastically - by the same set of fans when he was booked for diving . However when the Chelsea midfielder was substituted in the dying moments he was given an applause . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . There have been genuine signs of promise in N5 and reasons for optimism in 2015, even if Arsene Wenger was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against Jose Mourinho. It is 13 games and counting, and while the Arsenal boss insists it matters not a jot, it is much to Mourinho's amusement. 'It's about our club and our team, not about me,' said Wenger. 'We wanted to win the game for the club. What is important is what happens on the football pitch. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'We want to finish the season well. Every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season. We want to secure the top four, then the top three and the top two, before the FA Cup final.' To finish as runners-up, for the first time in a decade, and successfully defend the FA Cup, can be framed as progress. More significant is the development of Hector Bellerin, Francis Coquelin and Nacho Monreal. Together with a philosophical tweak, it has made Arsenal a more solid defensive unit, capable of taking points from Manchester City and Chelsea and winning at Manchester United in the FA Cup. Coquelin and Monreal were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly. This is not a typical Arsenal trait. Bellerin has been outstanding and few have contained Eden Hazard this season as effectively as the teenager did on Sunday, but Arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer. 'We have closed the gap since the start of the season,' said Wenger. 'But what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down. 'The build-up was quick and sharp but the final ball wasn't there.' With five to play, Arsenal trail the champions-elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching Chelsea in the knowledge their rivals from the capital's west will strengthen again in the summer. Amid the progress, there remain reasons for concern. Despite the flair overload of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, they could not break down a Mourinho team determined to protect their clean sheet. Spanish defender Hector Bellerin (left) has come on leaps and bounds for the Gunners this season . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Ozil had glimpses of goal, but Branislav Ivanovic did to Sanchez what Bellerin did to Hazard. Chelsea finished the game with a midfield trio of Nemanja Matic, Kurt Zouma and Ramires, which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a seven-man defensive shield. In the Sky Sports studio, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questioned the quality of 18-goal striker Olivier Giroud. 'Wenger has to strengthen,' said Henry. 'In order to win the league you need great players. I don't think you can win the league with Giroud. Nacho Monreal (left) is among the Gunners players who have impressed recently and did so against Chelsea . 'Chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy (Thibaut) Courtois, Cesc, Matic and (Diego) Costa. You see today the difference between a team that did and a team that didn't strengthen. Arsenal still need four top players.' Those four would be straight down the spine of the team. Imagine Arsenal if you threaded Courtois, John Terry, Matic and Costa through the centre of their fast and fluent side. Arsenal do not long for a Fabregas. They have players who can offer his vision and passing range. Perhaps the supporters who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this. Thierry Henry said Arsenal will not win the Premier League if they do not buy another striker . But Chelsea do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match-winning know-how which would provide a platform for those like Ozil, Sanchez and Cazorla to deliver. Henry must realise this is not the Wenger way but time for nurturing is running out. The Arsenal manager has two more years on what could be his final contract. If he is to close the gap, catch Chelsea next season and end this hoodoo against Mourinho, then it must be done in the summer transfer market.",217,90,"club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","arsenal, ball, alex, wenger, villa, alan, cross, robin, darren, derby,","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","derby football match, Arsenal football team, they could have snatched victory, the team's former manager, the ball hit the post","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.","This topic is about a derby football match, in which the ball hit the post; according to the Arsenal football team‚Äôs former manager, they could have snatched victory, but the ball hit the post.",This article focuses on the football team Arsenal in the United Kingdoms Premier League.

The current boss Arsene Wegner appears to have had a more nurturing approach trying to build up certain players potential.

Mike Pence, state health officials said on Friday. There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. That's up from 106 last week, said the Indiana State Department of Health. Health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested. But the growing number could put pressure on Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on March 26. Scroll down for video . More than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov. Mike Pence, there are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky . Spokeswoman Kara Brooks said Pence is reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and will make a decision early next week about extending the program beyond April 25. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller Opana, health officials have said. The county typically sees about five HIV cases each year. Since Pence approved the temporary needle exchange, 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants, health officials said Friday. About 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Brittany Combs, public health nurse for the Scott County Health Department, said the needle-exchange program had 'really picked up a lot this week,' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more IV drug users into the program. 'It's that trust factor. You have to gain that trust, and I think we're slowly starting to do that,' Combs said. But the future of the Scott County program, as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties, isn't clear. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller Opana, health officials have said . Pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy. Senate President Pro Tem David Long said on Thursday that the emergency exchange for Scott County was 'the right reaction' but wasn't sure if it is the correct approach long-term. Nor was he sure whether the Senate would support legislation sponsored by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere, R-New Albany, that would allow the 23 Indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis C to establish their own needle-exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis C are also infected with HIV. Health officials say because of this, high rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak. The House approved the bill on April 7 in a 54-39 vote, and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on Monday in a House-Senate conference committee, which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the Legislature's April 29 adjournment deadline. Long said Pence isn't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it. 'At the same time, you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in, so we're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us,' Long said. Medical waste containers stored in preparation for Scott County residents that are looking to exchange used needles. The needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence in an attempt to curb the state's largest-ever HIV outbreak . Clere said he appreciates Pence's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that 'it doesn't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak. It's just not enough.' He said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people, including lawmakers, uncomfortable. But he thinks the exchange program shouldn't be viewed as anti-drug policy, but as 'a proven and effective harm-reduction policy.' 'We simply can't afford to view this as a short-term problem,' Clere said. Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs. Pence's executive order didn't include money for the Scott County program. 'They asked the state agencies to find their own money. How sustainable is that?' said Dr. Beth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. 'There's no evidence that the Pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all.'",72,162,"health, virus, cases, people, bird, outbreak, infected, public, sick, flu,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","people infected with the virus, identify new cases, outbreak of measles, public health, new strain of flu, infected cases","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about people infected with the virus, identifying new cases, the outbreak of measles, public health, new strain of flu, and infected cases.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","There has been a significant increase in the number of HIV cases in Indiana since the past two weeks.

Property tycoon Elie Taktouk claimed the £5.5million sale of the family home in central London to a company owned by Fabregas was at least £2million under value and sued his ex-wife Daniella Semaan for compensation. But Deputy Judge Richard Snowden QC said such a claim 'has no real prospect of success' and dismissed it. He said the claim 'is yet another court battle between Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan arising out of the breakdown of their marriage in 2011 which led to their acrimonious divorce in 2013.' Cesc Fabregas's girlfriend, Daniella Semaan (left with Chelsea player), has won a High Court battle with her ex-husband, Elie Taktouk (right) after she sold her former marital home to the footballer . The judge said Mr Tartouk still owed Ms Semaan nearly £1million of a lump sum in a divorce order and legal costs of more than £500,000. Ms Semaan, 39, is currently pregnant with Fabregas's second daughter. They already have toddler, Lia, born in 2013. In January last year, Family Division judge Mr Justice Coleridge gave the go-ahead for the sale of the former family home in Belgravia to a Spanish firm Zirrintza owned by Mr Fabregas. In a preceding hearing, Mr Taktouk had claimed the property was being sold at 'significant undervalue', claiming it was worth up to £10million and at least £7million. But in allowing the sale, the judge said Mr Taktouk 'has a history of lacking credibility'. Deputy Judge Snowden said he had failed in a bid to appeal a previous ruling and had now launched these new proceedings. But he still owed his Lebanese born ex-wife almost £1million ordered to be paid as part of a £1.4million lump sum in divorce proceedings, the court heard. Ms Semaan originally hooked up with Fabregas in Spain when he played with Barcelona and she took her two children, aged 14 and 10, by Mr Taktouk with her. A row centred on a property in this London street, where Ms Semaan and Mr Tartouk used to live . Ms Semaan flew to Spain to be with Fabregas when he played for Barcelona. They have since had a daughter . They returned to London last summer after the player's £27million move to Chelsea. In a previous case, Mr Justice Coleridge ordered the sale of the Grade II listed flat in April 2013 when Mr Taktouk was ordered to pay his ex wife £1.4million to buy a new home. He claimed that if Mr Fabregas bought the former home she would end up staying there and have £1.4million in the bank. He also claimed a higher price was achievable. Also in April 2013, Mr Taktouk lost his bid to appeal against the financial settlement when he claimed that Fabregas would be keeping her in the future. The judge said Taktouk was financed by his wealthy father. Since then Mr Taktouk and his father undertook to pay a total of £680,000 owing in legal costs in a series of lump sum payments. The court heard £250,000 had been paid, but the balance with additional costs taking it over £500,000 are still to be paid. In dismissing his claim the judge said Mr Taktouk was seeking to argue the same points which had already been ruled on. Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan married 15 years ago when they were both 24 and living in Lebanon. A company owned by Fabregas, who moved back to London to play for Chelsea last year, bought the house .",78,115,"court, judge, case, appeal, justice, order, ruling, ruled, magistrates, ordered,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","a court ruling, department of justice, appealed against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, court order, magistrates","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about a court ruling, department of justice, appealing against a court ruling, judge reviewing a case, a court order, and magistrates.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","A property tycoon lost a court battle to his ex- wife for allegedly under pricing the sale of their luxury London home to chelsea footballer Cesc Fabregas.

'Let's get the three points with the supporters on Saturday, that's the first final.' Burnley arrive at St Mary's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend's win against champions Manchester City. Sean Dyche's men also got the better of Saints when they met earlier in the campaign and Alderweireld is eyeing revenge. 'It's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood, they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence,' he told Southampton's official YouTube channel. Alderweireld is looking for revenge when Southampton face Burnley after they were beaten earlier in the season . 'But at home, we need to win. We can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had, we have to do that, especially at home. 'We have to be patient, show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter. 'In the last game we deserved to win I think. We had the better chances and they had none really. 'We had the throw-in and then they scored, it was very unlucky. We could have won there so we want to get a little revenge. 'They have a lot of good players. That's the Premier League. When you're not 100 per cent, anyone can beat you, that's what people like about the Premier League. 'We have to be 100 per cent. They are in a good mood so we have to be at our best.

The three images showed Putin meeting with the head of the Supreme Court in Moscow on Friday, the Kremlin said. State broadcaster Russia 24 also aired video footage of the meeting. CNN cannot independently confirm that the meeting took place as stated. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov sought to quell the rumors of ill health on Thursday, joking that they were down to ""spring fever,"" Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported. ""When the sun comes up in spring, and as soon as spring is in the air, then the fever begins,"" Peskov said. ""Someone dreams of (Rosneft CEO Igor) Sechin resignation, others -- of government resignation, while others have not seen President Putin on TV for several days,"" he said, according to Tass. ""We are calm on this fever, and respond to the questions with patience,"" Peskov said. Speaking to Russian radio station Echo of Moscow, Peskov also urged people not to worry, saying that Putin was ""absolutely"" healthy. Asked if the President's handshake was firm, he replied that Putin ""can break a hand."" Last fall, rumors also circulated about the health of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, after he was absent from the public eye for more than a month. He eventually reappeared, with North Korean state media releasing photographs of him walking with a cane. The speculation about Putin began after a planned meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, between the Russian leader and the presidents of Kazakhstan and Belarus was postponed at short notice. Peskov confirmed Wednesday that the leaders had agreed to delay it for several days but did not give a new date, Tass said. The Kremlin press office said Friday that Putin would meet Monday with his Kyrgyz counterpart, Almazbek Atambayev, in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, Tass said. Putin's last public appearance was Sunday, on International Women's Day. Since then, he has had a number of meetings, but no video was released, only stills uploaded to the Kremlin's website. In the course of his many years in power, Putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader. His exploits, captured on film and released to the media, have included riding horses while shirtless, exploring the seafloor in a submersible, handling a tranquilized tiger and, just last year, earning a karate black belt.

357,37XITHEISYBDE6CTTS0TVHLQ23ECRN,0c1248ebdaddd02d9df8d7e1c8aa4e1ada8be1de,"There is a rich and mildly amusing irony about Arsenal fans calling Chelsea boring for defending well, when these Gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04. They drew four of their last seven, the lifeless goalless stalemate at home to Birmingham a particular highlight. Instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on Chelsea's title winners, maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players, and in particular Mesut Ozil. Mesut Ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he didn't do enough against Chelsea on Sunday . The German, celebrating the FA Cup win over Reading, needs to start performing to live up to his £42m tag . I've enjoyed some of Ozil's recent performances, he's been sublime more than spectacular, but he's definitely been a joy to watch. And so as I sat down to watch Arsenal face Chelsea, I felt confident that Ozil could be the difference between the two teams. I also felt that Arsenal could win the game, and win it well. And that if they did win it well, it would put huge pressure on Chelsea in the run-in. I felt there would be a chance that a big result for Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday might just open the title door for the Gunners. But it wasn't to be. And come the big moment, the big player fluffed his lines. Ozil wasn't terrible but he didn't impact the game enough. While Cesc Fabregas was sending a killer pass only for Oscar to be wiped out by the goalkeeper (how is that not a penalty?), and Willian carved Arsenal up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to Ramires, Ozil was tidy, nothing more. Cesc Fabregas outshone Ozil on Sunday as Chelsea showed why they are ahead of Arsenal this season . Fabregas, who left the Emirates pitch with Ozil's shirt, would have been better than the German for Arsenal . Ozil takes on Cesar Azpilicueta in a game where he was fine, but not good enough to change the result . He didn't stand out. He didn't impact the game enough to affect the result. He didn't show any signs of being world class, or worth £42million. And then when he had the chance to be the match winner, Ozil completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him. Poor technique. In the second half Chelsea played into Ozil's hands. They effectively gave him the ball and asked him what he could do. If he's as good as he's purported to be, he kills off Chelsea with his ability on the ball. But he couldn't create the winning goal. For all of Arsenal's pivotal, meaningful, must-win games in the last two seasons, Ozil has looked average. Even in the FA Cup final last year it was Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey who stood out, while Ozil failed to shine, complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in English football. He was the most expensive player on the pitch on Sunday and come the end of his Arsenal career he will be judged on his impact. Ozil could go down the same route as Juan Sebastian Veron (left) and Andriy Shevchenko . When Thierry Henry says Arsenal need a new spine of their team, it's time to start listening . A player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime. He has to have a major impact in the big games, he has to take the team to another level. Two seasons have gone and Ozil has failed to do that at Arsenal. There are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the Premier League ‚ Andriy Shevchenko, Fernando Torres, Juan Sebastian Veron, and we're still waiting for the biggest of them all ‚ Angel di Maria - to show us what he can do. Ozil could be joining that list unless he delivers something amazing next season. When an Arsenal legend like Thierry Henry points out that after all this time Arsene Wenger has constructed a team without a spine ‚ Henry said they need a goalkeeper, a centre half, a defensive midfielder, and a top striker ‚ you have to listen. He's right of course, but the knock-on effect is that the top players Arsenal have in their team need to deliver something extra special. And Ozil has failed to do that. In one of the biggest games of Arsenal's season, Ozil missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way . Arsenal fans are defensive of the Germany midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations . Henry said what all Arsenal fans know, but most refuse to admit ‚ Fabregas would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than Ozil has. There's a lot of goodwill from Arsenal fans towards Ozil ‚ they want him to be the hero, they want him to be their superstar. And that desperation means some have over-praised his performances. They're hoping it's some kind of twisted self-fulfilling prophecy ‚ if they keep saying Ozil is brilliant, then maybe he will be. Witness this tweet about Ozil from Arsenal fan @girlgooner two weeks ago: 'I still can't believe he plays for my team Arsenal, I think we are very lucky, he's a very special player.' It seems you only have to sign for Arsenal these days to be a legend. That's how well Wenger has managed and manipulated standards and expectations at this once great football club. As for Ozil, he's been good. But he needs to be brilliant.",217,90,"club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","arsenal, ball, alex, wenger, villa, alan, cross, robin, darren, derby,","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","derby football match, Arsenal football team, they could have snatched victory, the team's former manager, the ball hit the post","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.","This topic is about a derby football match, in which the ball hit the post; according to the Arsenal football team‚Äôs former manager, they could have snatched victory, but the ball hit the post.","There were high hopes for Ozil to do well against Chelsea, however, his performance did not meet the expectations.

An increase in television money for UEFA will also see prize money for the Champions League go up but the disparity with the Europa League will not be so great from 2015-18. At the moment, clubs in the Champions League earn an average of four and half times as much as those playing in the Europa League, but in the future UEFA will fix the ratio at 3.3 to one.

Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables sent two days before the crash, Germany failed to pass on the warning, local media reported. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, and all 298 aboard were killed. Warning: Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables two days before the MH17 crash, the German government failed to pass on the warning . German foreign ministry cables sent on July 15, cited an incident from the day before when a Ukrainian air force plane was shot down at around 20,000 feet over rebel-held territory. German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security, and had assessed the downing of the Ukrainian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. Earlier this month, the Dutch government - which lost 189 citizens in the disaster - said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted . to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it flew over Ukraine last July. After a meeting of foreign ministers from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the . sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, Holland's Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said there was general agreement on this course of action. Tragedy: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17 last year, and all 298 aboard were killed . 'Now that we're very far with repatriation (of the victims' remains), investigation and prosecution are becoming more . central,' Koenders said in a statement. 'The ministers believe that prosecution is not only . important for the countries with victims on board. Civil aviation . is vulnerable and every safety violation is a concern shared . worldwide.' Forensics laboratories in the Netherlands have identified . remains of 296 of the 298 MH17 victims and recovered large parts of the wreckage . for investigation.

Tesco does still have the biggest share of the lucrative market, which research by Kantar shows has grown by more than 10 per cent over the last year and is now worth £490million. The leader has improved its market share in the increasingly fashionable premium ale market, but it's believed Aldi is luring customers away from Tesco, offering a smaller range but cheaper prices. Another chapter: Fluctuations in the premium ale market are just a small part of the shopping revolution which has seen shoppers flock away from giants like Tesco and towards the growing discounters . To use an example of the difference in price, Aldi sells bottles of Newcastle brown ale for £1.24. They costs £1.64 at Tesco and Waitrose and £1.65 at Morrisons. The discounter has also increased wine sales by 24 per cent over the last years which shows drinkers with all tastes are now flocking to Aldi to buy their booze. It's another chapter in the rise of discounters who are slowly stealing market share from the big three, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Other research, also by Kantar, showed that Aldi overtook Waitrose as Britain's sixth biggest supermarket with its performance in the first three months of 2015, increasing share of the whole supermarket industry from 4.6 top 5.3 per cent in a year. The top four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all lost market share in the first three months of 2015. Aldi, Waitrose and Lidl managed to increase thiers, with Aldi showing the biggest rise . Tesco has had a troublesome year, with its year-on-year share price down 18 per cent. Last year, they discovered a £263million gap in their accounts which involved rebates to suppliers and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Shortly afterwards they sacked boss Phil Clarke who was replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis, who announced a series of money-saving measures to try and turn the tide.. The research into the premium ale market doesn't tell a very consistent story, with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share. Sainsbury's currently has the second largest share in the beer market which it has improved by 7 per cent while Asda, third, increased by 1.5 per cent. Upmarket Waitrose, which also saw a double-digit increase in the premium ale market, now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry. But while Aldi made great gains, Lidl, the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry, saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market. Morrisons' share dipped 1.4 per cent . In January Tesco published the location of 43 loss-making stores that will close, and shelved plans to open a further 49 stores. City bosses expect them to announce huge losses in profit next week. It's been a totally different story for Aldi, which offers cheap prices and a smaller range that have helped them compete with the big boys. Aldi ‚ motto Spend a little. Live a lot ‚ stocks virtually all own-branded goods and and they're market share has grown by 0.7 per cent this year. It plans to open 60 new stores in 2015, more than than Sainsbury's and Tesco put together. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. The total market share of the 'big four' fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl also saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share.

Fabio Lovato, 30, created a short video that played following the cinema trailers for Fast and Furious 7 showcasing pictures from where they met in Australia. The one minute and 30 second video ended with a picture of the couple and the words, 'Laura I have a questions for you'. Scroll down for video . Fabio Lavato proposed to his girlfriend Laura Knight in their local Cineworld in Gloucester . Fabio then got down on one knee in the Cineworld in Gloucester and popped the question to his shocked girlfriend Laura Knight, 29. Italian-born Fabio, who now lives in Quedgeley, Gloucester with Laura, says that he always knew he wanted to marry Laura. He said: 'It was love at first sight for me. I always knew she was the one and I wanted to make sure the proposal was extra special. 'Lots of people propose at restaurants so I just thought it would be great to do it at the cinema where a video could be played on the screen and she would be completely surprised. Fabio created a video showcasing pictures of their time together followed by the words 'Laura I have a question for you' that was played at the end of the trailers of Fast and Furious 7 . The film included pictures from their time together in Australia, 2013, where the couple met . 'It was absolutely amazing and I am so glad she said yes.' The pair met while Laura was backpacking around Asia, ending up in Australia, and Fabio was working in the country. Laura says she had no idea that Fabio was planning to propose - especially not in the cinema. She said: 'The trailers finished and these pictures of Australia started to play. 'I thought it must be an advert at first but the song was one we were introduced to over in Australia and it is not well known over here - they wouldn't have used it on an advert.' Pretty soon Laura, a deputy manager at a dental practice, clicked that there was something suspicious about the 'advert'. Fabio has lived with Laura, pictured together, in Quedgeley, Gloucester, since last year . The pair are both big film fans so the cinema acted as the perfect location for the proposal . 'The pictures kept playing and I began thinking to myself they looked familiar. 'The next thing I know it was a giant picture of myself and then a picture of us as a couple. 'That's when I thought ""oh my God"" - I was over whelmed. He got on one knee and everyone started clapping.' Fabio, a hospital record clerk, had been planning the event for two months, talking to Laura's parents, the cinema, friends and colleagues. The proposal took meticulous planning with Fabio waiting until he was alone to make the film so that Laura wouldn't notice. Despite the pair being massive film buffs Laura was too excited to stay and watch the rest of the film, but says it was the perfect proposal. Although Laura loved the proposal she says she doesn't rate Fast and Furious . 'I thought it was amazing. I have a love for films myself. We share that, both having a passion for films. 'For him to do it like that meant a lot. Although it wasn't personal in terms of people being there, it was personal to me, because of the way he did it.' Although Laura was completely overjoyed by the proposal she admits that Fabio's choice of film was questionable. 'The fact that the cinema let us do it was amazing. There is no connection to the film though really, it was just what was showing at the time. 'I wouldn't rate Fast And Furious in my top 10. It was a big film though and completely sold out. 'I'm glad it wasn't Cinderella because it would have just been children. Luckily, no popcorn came my way.'

Lovato knew that this would not be a typical viewing experience and was more excited about the movie he made himself than the film, despite it being his choice as Knight reported that it was his pick and not one she would necessarily go out of her way to see on her own. The genre and film did not play a crucial role in their special trip to the movies, the only crucial detail was the movie time. Lovato was not the only one interested in seeing this film as it was sold out and turned out to be a blockbuster hit. The packed theater was a nice touch in their experience as the couple received a round of applause after they witness Lovato proposing to Knight, seeing them walk in as boyfriend/girlfriend and leaving an engaged couple!","After two months of meticulous and at times, sneaky planning, Fabio Lovato, 30 sat in the movie theater in Quedgeley, Gloucester, eagerly awaiting for the movie trailers to end so he could ask his girlfriend of a year to be his wife. Lovato took his time in planning all the details, ensuring the moment be special, unforgettable, and most importantly, a surprise! Since Lovato and his now fianc Laura Knight, 29 are both huge fans of the cinema, making them frequent customers of the movie theater, he decided that proposing while they were enjoying one of their favorite activities was the way to go. Lovato gave the movie theater a short minute and a half clip he made that showed pictures of where the couple met in Australia, ending it with the simple text, ""Laura, I have a question for you."" Laura remembers the moment and her love for Lovato shines, reporting that she had no idea he was going to pop the question, let alone at the movie theater after the movie trailers in front of a packed crowd!"

Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich filled our final March trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. 1. Another ""Draft Warren"" movement? If you follow politics, you have heard this one: Liberals say Elizabeth Warren has to run for president because Hillary Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street. And now that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top Senate Democratic job -- you are about to hear this: Warren has to run for leader because Chuck Schumer is too cozy with Wall Street. The senator from Massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run, but Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left. ""What this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with Chuck Schumer, because he's so close to Wall Street, and it's an issue they've really been hammering on,"" Kucinich said. ""So watch for more of that, because I have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard, through Warren or not."" 2. A good week for Boehner. Yes, you read that right. It has been a rocky year for House Speaker John Boehner, but his allies think they may have just turned a corner. The House of Representatives passed the Republican budget last week as well as a big Medicare change known as the ""doc fix"" because it clarifies reimbursement rates to Medicare providers. NPR's Juana Summers shared reporting on how Team Boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore. ""Part of (his success) is because of the speaker's willingness to use unconventional tactics, to work with Democrat Nancy Pelosi for that Medicare reform,"" Summers said. ""Congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return. So whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating."" 3. Bush-Rubio? Rubio-Bush? Watch the real estate listings! Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio both call Florida home. And both want to be the Republican nominee for president. They also happen to be on friendly terms. So among Florida Republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a ""dream ticket."" Of course, it won't happen. Can't happen. Rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state. (Dick Cheney changed his residency from Texas to Wyoming right before joining the George W. Bush ticket.) But Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post said the obstacles aren't preventing Florida Republicans from doing a little dreaming. ""They say, look, Bush has all this executive experience, he's bilingual, he has a Mexican-American wife,"" O'Keefe said. ""Rubio is young. He has an interest in foreign policy. Why not?"" 4. Ted Cruz wants to ""rock"" the youth vote. Much was made of the fact that Liberty University students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which Ted Cruz announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. But it gave Cruz a big crowd -- and Robert Costa of The Washington Post reports that Team Cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement. ""He's playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months,"" Costa said. ""And he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives, who aren't really familiar with Bush and are looking for someone new."" 5. Is Kasich waiting for a ""summer wave""? John Kasich had a well-regarded visit to New Hampshire last week. And he got a decent buzz out of a New York fund-raising stop, too. So is he ready to launch and join the crowded GOP 2016 presidential field? Not so fast. Two New Hampshire Republicans keeping close tabs on GOP visitors say he wouldn't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run. A national GOP source plugged into to the Kasich operation says the governor hasn't made a firm decision, and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call. That, too, is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run. This national source said Kasich is one of two GOP governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a ""summer wave"" of new entries. The other, according to this source, is GOP Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.",113,162,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich are presidential possibilities on the republican side. Many liberals believe that Elizabeth Warren has to run for president because Hillary Clinton is too close to Wall St. They also say the same thing about Chuck Schumer. Harry Reid is planning to retire which leaves a huge hole for the top democratic job.,Both Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio call Florida home. There is talk of a dream ticket of Bush and Rubio. But the rule is that generally the presidential ticket shouldn't have two candidates from the same state. Dick Cahaney changed his residency from Texas to Wyoming before joining George W. Bush on the presidential ticket.

He did so beaming from ear to ear, admitting that he had seen the tweets from his Manchester United team-mates congratulating him on scoring what he called 'one of the most important goals of my life'. Not everyone had been as complimentary as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney, with Sky pundit Thierry Henry criticizing him for not immediately running to Cristiano Ronaldo who played the ball to him for the goal. Javier Hernandez (left) scores to send Real Madrid into the Champions League semi-final . Hernandez struck in the 88th minute to send Madrid through and fierce rivals Atletico Madrid out . Marca (left) say Hernandez scored 'the goal of his life' while AS praises 'Chicharito' for winning the tie . To pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the Mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best ‚ score big goals in big games. 'It was a great assist [from Ronaldo]' he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the Real Madrid supporters behind the stadium's south goal, had subsided. Despite starting only seven of the fifty games Real Madrid have played this season Hernandez has wriggled his way into the affections of the club's supporters much and on three occasions, he got himself into goalscoring positions on Wednesday night. With the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance ‚ shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with Ronaldo and Isco better placed, and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period. But when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded. His name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign. There was nothing special about the finish but getting there, to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) provided a splendid assist for Hernandez's goal in the Champions League . Hernandez celebrates Madrid's victory with team-mate Ronaldo after the final whistle . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick led the tributes to Hernandez on Twitter after the game . The Spanish radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy, all wanted to ask him about the last great Mexican striker to wear the white shirt, Hugo Sanchez. With a goals-per-minutes ratio that is better than Karim Benzema's, there are even claims he should be starting more games. He replaced the Frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games. Once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides, Benzema's extra quality has to be recognized and 'El Chicharito's' place will eventually be back on the bench. In the longer-term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night. But he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season, when he returns to United, it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere. 'He has suffered' said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. 'He deserved the goal because he has never given in. He always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays. It's a great reward for him.' Had the 88th minute strike not come and Atletico held on to win on penalties, Ancelotti would have been criticized for his faith in the Mexican and the 'Little Pea' might have played his last minutes for Madrid with only the league left to contest. Some believe Hernandez should start more often ahead of Karim Benzema, who currently has a knee injury . Hernandez missed a couple of chances before scoring, but his persistence eventually paid off for Madrid . Real's players celebrate after Hernandez's late goal secured progress to the Champions League semi-final . As it is Madrid still have nine games to play and he will play his part. He has already written himself a little piece of Madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do.

The exact timing of the Cuba trip wasn't immediately released, but the Vatican said the Pope would stop in Cuba before his planned late September stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. In Havana's Cathedral Square, people reacted joyously to the news. ""The Pope coming here, maybe he could ... make more positive ways for Cubans to go towards religion, more than politics,"" said Raul Garcia, a Cuban-American who returned to the island. ""I think it's going to be a very good visit, very beneficial for the country."" ""We are waiting for him. We're very happy he is coming,"" said Ulises, a man who sells brightly colored paintings of antique cars to tourists on the street next to the sprawling Havana Cathedral. ""He should come and get to know it and walk around the pretty spots in Havana."" Cuba's state-run television reported that Francis would visit, but like the Vatican did not report exactly when he would arrive. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, played a role in restarting diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, earning praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The Pope made personal pleas to Obama and Cuban leaders in private letters, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where they hashed out aspects of a new trade policy and discussed the release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed as part of the detente between the two countries. ""I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,"" Obama said in December as he announced a U.S. policy shift on Cuba. Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has displayed a deep interest in international affairs. He repeatedly urged Western leaders not to bomb Syria, hosted a prayer service between Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the Vatican and waded into diplomatic controversy last week by referring to the killing of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago as a ""genocide."" The latter move deeply upset Turkish leaders, who recalled their Vatican ambassador. The Pope is expected to continue his international activism in July with a trip to South America, where he will visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. In late September, Francis will visit Washington, where he will address Congress; New York, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly; and Philadelphia, where he will celebrate a public Mass that's expected to draw more than 1 million people. Francis will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. Church officials in Havana said that they expect Francis' visit to be shorter than those of his predecessors. Officials from the Vatican are expected to travel to the island soon to finalize logistics for Francis' trip, the officials said . CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report from Rome.",162,97,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","visit, pope, peace, catholic, roman, ceremony, meeting, anniversary, commonwealth, archbishop,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","visiting the pope, roman catholic church, archbishop, ceremonial meeting for peace","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about visiting the pope, roman catholic church, archbishop, and ceremonial meeting for peace.","The Pope is planning to visit Cuba some time this summer.

A new survey has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $13.44 since just 2013. By contrast, babysitters in 2009 made an average $10.50 an hour. Average babysitter wages have increased by 28 per cent in the last 5 years, as the graphic by Care.com reveals . But the cost for care has risen much higher than a couple of dollars for certain cities. The Care.com survey, which had more than one thousand respondents, revealed that babysitters are most expensive in San Francisco, where they make an average of $16.65 per hour. That's five dollars more than the city's minimum wage. Boston and Silicon Valley hub San Jose are not far behind, with rates clocking in at $15.37 and $15.63, respectively. New York City, unsurprisingly, still made it in the top five with a $15.09 rate. Costs significantly drop further from the coast. Babysitters make, on average, $11.31 an hour in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the cheapest of the rates. Cities in South Carolina, Utah and Ohio round out the top five least-expensive babysitter wages with costs in the $11 rage - with Rochester, New York, also making a surprise appearance. Although one in four parents said they believe they're paying their babysitters too much, the survey found they also have no problem upping the costs. Eighty-seven per cent of parents give their sitters an annual raise, and 26 per cent will tip them. And one in 10 parents is willing to throw in an extra $5 an hour if they booked their caregiver on short notice. Only three per cent of families said they choose their sitter based on expected wages. Forty-nine per cent of families select a sitter loved by their children. A new survey by Care.com has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $13.44 since just 2013 . According to Care.com's senior managing editor Katie Bugbee, parents today expect more from their sitters - and are willing to pay the price. 'Parents want experience,' she told Yahoo! Parenting. 'They value that. It's not longer the kid down the street who will just sit there and eat Doritos all night.' That means, according to the survey, that the babysitter is between 20 to 25 years old, doesn't smoke and is certified in First Aid or CPR training. Bugbee said that, on the flip side, sitters are likewise working harder to make more of child care. 'Millennials are graduating college and becoming nannies or babysitters and the interest is there to perfect the profession,' she said. 'We're seeing the evolution of the field on both sides.' Surprisingly, over half of the surveyed parents said they've hired a babysitter without running a background check or checking listed references. But a whopping 94 per cent of families said they have complete trust in their child caregivers. And many parents will go to incredible lengths to keep them around. Twenty per cent of parents said they'd be willing to poach another family's babysitter and 16 per cent said they wouldn't share a great sitter's contact with their own friends. But that's hardly shocking.

Ibrahim al-Rubaish died Monday night in what AQAP's media wing, Al-Malahem Media, called a ""crusader airstrike."" The Al-Malahem Media obituary characterized al-Rubaish as a religious scholar and combat commander. A Yemeni Defense Ministry official and two Yemeni national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that al-Rubaish had been killed, but could not specify how he died. Al-Rubaish was once held by the U.S. government at its detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In fact, he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then-President George W. Bush to challenge the legality of their confinement in Gitmo. He was eventually released as part of Saudi Arabia's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists, a program that U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, characterized as ""a failure."" In December 2009, Sessions listed al-Rubaish among those on the virtual "" 'Who's Who' of al Qaeda terrorists on the Arabian peninsula ... who have either graduated or escaped from the program en route to terrorist acts."" The United States has been active in Yemen, working closely with governments there to go after AQAP leaders like al-Rubaish. While it was not immediately clear how he died, drone strikes have killed many other members of the terrorist group. Yemen, however, has been in disarray since Houthi rebels began asserting themselves last year. The Shiite minority group even managed to take over the capital of Sanaa and, in January, force out Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- who had been a close U.S. ally in its anti-terror fight. Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader, and he is working with a Saudi-led military coalition to target Houthis and supporters of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Meanwhile, Yemen has been awash in violence and chaos -- which in some ways has been good for groups such as AQAP. A prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners, including some senior AQAP figures, according to a senior Defense Ministry official, and the United States pulled the last of its special operations forces out of Yemen last month, which some say makes things easier for AQAP.

Scientists found traces of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates, a vital source of nutrients for living things on Earth. The discovery is the latest feather in the cap for the theory that while Mars is barren and dry now, it was once habitable. Nasa scientists in California found evidence of nitrogen on Mars. Findings were made by Curiosity's (shown) Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. The scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on Earth. It was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes . The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In their paper, the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars. The Earth's nitrogen-rich atmosphere made life possible, but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery. Now, scientists believe they have found the answer: that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes, also made the atmosphere habitable. Geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in Earth's atmosphere three billion years ago. Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Carnegie Institution of Washington researchers explained in October 2014 that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis, as well as tectonic activity. While scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen, which makes up one fifth of the Earth's atmosphere, the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery. 'Discovery of indigenous martian nitrogen in Mars surface materials has important implications for habitability and, specifically, for the potential evolution of a nitrogen cycle at some point in martian history,' they wrote. The latest evidence was found by using the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), more commonly known as Curiosity. The discoveries were made at areas of Mars known as John Klein and Cumberland. The scientists note that this particular nitrate likely resulted from an asteroid impact, or lightning in a volcanic plume. Nitrogen is a key component of things like RNA, DNA and amino acids, and thus important for life. Nitrates themselves are important because they are a good source of nitrogen for living things. The next step will be to see if nitrates are still being produced on Mars. 'People want to follow the carbon, but in many ways nitrogen is just as important a nutrient for life,' said Dr Jennifer Stern, a science team member for the Mars Science Laboratory mission, reported LA Times. 'Life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon.' Shown is Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument. In their paper the team of researchers said the nitrogen could indicate the first stage of a primitive nitrogen cycle on the surface of ancient Mars. This could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on Mars . This follows news in December 2014 when the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface. 'This temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively localised source,' said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Curiosity rover science team, at the time. 'There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.' Previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet. But none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden 'venting' measured at Gale Crater, where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago. Curiosity landed in the 96 mile-wide (154km) crater in August 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since. Since it landed, conclusive evidence has been found that Mars once had water on its surface, and now scientists are hoping to provide an answer once and for all to the greatest question: Was there, or is there still, life on Mars as well?",100,198,"earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","study, researchers, google, scientists, university, data, journal, human, humans, dna,","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","study by researchers, university researchers, scientific journals, scientists at Google, studying humans, the data showed","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","This topic is about university researchers, scientific journals, studying humans, and studies by researchers.",Atmosphere around earth is mainly consisting of Nitrogen.

A commission designed to review evidence about the world-changing bombings has not delved into an FBI agent's claims that a Saudi Florida family had ties to the hijackers after the agency said that the report was 'unsubstantiated'. Relatives of homeowner Esam Ghazzawi lived in the plush Sarasota dwelling until they fled and left cars, furniture and food in their refrigerator behind right before the 9/11, prompting some to say they knew about the attacks. Scroll down for video . The FBI's handling of reports about a Saudi family fleeing Florida two weeks before the 9/11 attacks has raised suspicion that the agency is whitewashing any involvement by the Middle Eastern country . The family of Abdulaziz al-Hijji and his wife Anoud left their 3,300 square foot Florida home in August 2001, but did not take cars, furniture or food from their fridge . The daughter and son-in-law of Ghazzawi, who worked as an adviser to a member of the Saudi royal family, had stayed at the 3,300 square foot house for six years but left in late August 2001, not even leaving a forwarding address. An FBI agent who investigated the disappearance after neighbors thought it was suspicious said that the family had 'many connections to individuals associated with the terrorist attacks on 9/11/2001'. At least one 'family member' had attended the same Venice, Florida, flight school as some of the hijackers, according to a piece in the New York Post. Mohamed Atta, the leader of the hijackers, and two other terrorists on the flights, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah, were also reported to have visited the Sarasota house, according to Florida Bulldog. Anoud Al-Hijji, Ghazzawi's daughter, later returned to America to sell the home. The 9/11 Commission wrote that 'The FBI told the Review Commission that the [FBI report] on which the news article was based was ""poorly written"" and wholly unsubstantiated...' 'When questioned later by others in the FBI, the special agent who wrote [it] was unable to provide any basis for the contents of the document or explain why he wrote it as he did'. Esam Ghazzawi, who owned the Sarasota home, was an adviser to a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd (left). Some observers have speculated that the Middle Eastern country helped back Osama Bin Laden (right) Ziad Samir Jarrah (left) Mohamed Atta (center) and Marwan Al-Shehhi (right) all reportedly visited the Florida home owned by the Saudi advisor at points before they carried out the heinous 9/11 attacks . The Review Commission said the FBI claimed it 'found no evidence that connected the family members in the Miami Herald article to any of the 9/11 hijackers, nor was there any connection found between the family and the 9/11 plot'. The FBI's dismissal of the report has led some to question whether the agency is covering up evidence of possible Saudi backing for 9/11. Former Florida Senator Bob Graham told the Miami Herald: 'The FBI has served America through most of its history. There were stumbles by the agency before 9/11 and since the tragedy there has been a consistent effort to cover up the extent of Saudi Arabia's involvement.' The Congressional Joint Inquiry into the attack, which Graham co-chaired, contained 28 fully pages that are said to have spoken about who financed 9/11 that were fully redacted by the Bush administration. Senator Graham said the pages 'point a very strong finger' at the government of Saudi Arabia, rather than wealthy Saudi individuals, as the backers of the attack. They also implicate officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington for involvement with 9/11 hijackers in San Diego, sources told Hoover Institute fellow Paul Sperry. The FBI told the 9/11 Review Commission that the original report about the Sarasota family's connections was unsubstantiated. Above, the National September 11 Memorial in New York City . Some such as former Florida senator Bob Graham (right) have said that there has been a consistent effort to cover up Saudi involvement. Left, the World Trade Center memorial . The recent Review Commission, which was created by Congress last year to look into evidence not considered by the FBI, said there was 'no evidence' that Saudi officials were involved. Information about the Sarasota family was not included in the original 2004 9/11 Commission report and the information was not shared with Congress. The agent in question was not identified. The Commission did not interview him or Senator Graham or his investigators. Review Commission officials' report said that the FBI needed to strengthen information sharing to combat further terrorist threats. Abdulaziz al-Hijji, the son-in-law who lived in Sarasota, has recently lived in London and worked for Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, according to the Telegraph. 'I love the USA. My kids were born there, I went to college and university there, I spent a good portion of my life there and I love it,' he said in 2012. Reports have claimed that al-Hijji and his father-in-law Ghazzawi were both on FBI watch lists before 9/11.

The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity.

A bungling drug dealer was caught selling heroin by an undercover police officer who recognised him because he has his initials tattooed on his face. Patrick Revins, 49, sold £10-worth of the Class A drug, which was hidden in a Kinder Egg, to the policeman in November 2013, a court was told. The detective was easily able to identify who sold him the drugs - as Revins has 'P' and 'R' tattooed on either side of his forehead. Revins, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, admitted one count of supplying heroin and was sentenced to a year in jail. That will be added to the 27-month prison sentence he is already serving for possession of knives. Revins' tattoos were also his downfall last year when he walked into a branch of Barclays in Hanley, Staffordshire, armed with a large bread knife. Bank staff asked him to leave after he was muttering about how he was 'going to do' someone. He then lifted his top and pulled the knife from the front of his trousers. Revins put the blade back into his trousers and left the bank but was arrested 20 minutes later after staff identified him by his distinctive tattoos. Police seized a large kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade. Two days later, while on bail, Revins was stopped again, and found to be carrying a bayonet and a large carving knife. Police arrested him again. At yesterday's hearing, prosecutor Joanne Barker told Judge Paul Glenn that Revins was caught by undercover police alongside fellow drug dealer Nathan Davenport, 37. Ms Barker said: 'Davenport first came to the attention of the police in September 2013. Revins, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured) yesterday, admitted one count of supplying heroin and was sentenced to 12 months in jail. Revins was caught by undercover police alongside fellow drug dealer Nathan Davenport (pictured) 'The undercover police officer met with another man who took him to an address where the two defendants were living. 'Nathan Davenport took them to a van and wrote down his contact details before handing over £20 worth of heroin. 'The next occasion the police operative met up with Davenport, the operative saw Patrick Revins there. 'In November, the operative saw Patrick Revins. Mr Revins asked the operative what he wanted and he said heroin. Mr Revins took some from a Kinder Egg and gave it to him for £10.' Davenport pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs between September 2013 and March 2014 and was jailed for 45 months. Andrew Jackson, defending Davenport, said: 'He is a man who has been bedeviled by a strong addiction of drugs.'

Among them, the family of eight-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest victim to lose his life in the April 15, 2013 attack, headed to Boylston Street to help officials unveil commemorative banners. Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site. They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony. Scroll down for video .

Ceremony: Jane and Henry Martin remove a drape covering a memorial banner to honor the victims. In total, four large orange banners were unveiled near the explosion sites on Tuesday morning . Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker. At 2.49pm, a moment of silence was held to mark the moment the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line two years ago, while church bells sounded throughout the city. Well-wishers visited the site of the explosions throughout Tuesday to pay tribute to the young people who had lost their lives, and stopped to pay their respects at a memorial bearing their names. Mayor Walsh has declared April 15 'One Boston Day,' on which Bostonians are encouraged to perform random acts of kindness and generosity.

She was at the marathon with her young son, Noah, and was less than 10 feet from where the first bomb exploded. She needed 17 surgeries and eventually had her left leg amputated last year.

'It is extremely emotional to look back on the last two years of my life,' she wrote. 'To remember what it felt like to be bleeding out on the pavement, wondering if I would ever see my child's smile again... 'It's been a long road. Some days, I'm not quite sure how I have made it out of the bed. And if I'm being really honest, a few times I haven't. 'But no matter what, there is one thing that I always keep in mind. I am BLESSED. And no matter how hard someone tries, they will never be able to take that away from me.' She plans to run the last three miles of the marathon next Monday. She also visited the site last year, but was pushed in a wheelchair as she struggled with issues with her leg.

As per their contract, Hockenheim is scheduled to host the event in 2016, but at this early stage F1 supremo Ecclestone is uncertain whether it will go ahead. Asked whether he could confirm it would take place, Ecclestone, speaking to a select media group in the paddock at the Malaysian Grand Prix, replied: 'No.' Bernie Ecclestone (left) says German Grand Prix may miss out on the Formula One calendar next year . Informed that Hockenheim has a contract for 2016 and 2018, Ecclestone added: 'It doesn't make a difference. A lot of people have a contract.' Ecclestone intimated if Germany was unable to afford the race this year, then it will struggle to pay the hosting fee next season. The Nurburgring was scheduled to host the race in July, but due to numerous financial difficulties behind the scenes was ultimately forced to withdraw. Ecclestone then turned to Hockenheim to step in and fill the void, but negotiations broke down and time ran out as circuit officials believed they did not have ample time to promote and sell tickets. Hockenheim and Nurburgring have hosted the German Grand Prix for the past seven years . 'The trouble in Germany was the Nurburgring spent an awful lot of money which they borrowed,' added Ecclestone. 'They didn't need to spend what they spent, and therefore didn't need to borrow the amount they borrowed. 'They forgot to pay it back, and that caused a few ripples. It sent a bad message.' Ecclestone didn't confirm if Hockenheim would host next year's race despite having a contract in place . Historic European races are now fast falling away with France, San Marino and now Germany losing their place on the calendar in recent times. Italy is another that will struggle to pay its way beyond the expiry of its current contract in 2016 unless national government steps in to assist, or Ecclestone reduces his fees. Asked whether he was prepared to see F1's European heartland wither away, Ecclestone said: 'There are lots of things we all would like, but we don't have them because we can't afford them.' Suggested to Ecclestone 'if Monza goes, it goes', he said: 'Whatever goes, goes.' The Formula One supremo said Hockenheim having a contract in place 'doesn't make a difference' Ecclestone did concede, however, 'it would be terrible' if Europe did lose all its races, particularly as the series would no longer become a world championship. Many people believe Ecclestone's hosting fees are too steep, which in turn prompts promoters to charge extortionate ticket prices, leading to reduced numbers through the turnstiles. Hockenheim, for instance, saw its audience plummet from more than 100,000 in 2012 to just 60,000 in 2014, despite Sebastian Vettel being a four-time world champion at that stage and Mercedes dominating last year. 'Probably right,' said Ecclestone, regarding comments about over-charging. 'But the teams get 62 per cent of whatever profit the company (CVC, who run the sport) makes, so if we make less money, the teams make less money.'

Because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century: the fruits of radical Islam. The results of the Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. Not to mention here in the United States, Canada and Europe. Is it not a tragic irony that the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving Libya a failed state and Yemen a failing state? The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in Iraq, which could soon spill over into Jordan. Plus, Libya is now being used as a rear operating base by ISIS and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the Middle East, even as they plan attacks in Europe and North America. Given the frightfully slow pace America's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas. And neither the United States nor our Western allies are immune to this cancer. Academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinctly different. But the fact is they are not -- their agendas, which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today, are manifestations of radical Islam. Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naØve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be. There is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world's most powerful politician and his national security team. Just take the National Strategy for Counterterrorism published by the White House in 2011. That document contained the assertion that, ""Since the beginning of 2011, the transformative change sweeping North Africa and the Middle East -- along with the death of Osama bin Laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat, par-ticularly as the relevance of al Qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished."" Yet, fast forward to January 2014 and America's top intelligence official, director of National Intelligence James Clapper, advised Congress that al Qaeda was no less capable of threatening the United States and our allies than a decade earlier. Soon after Clapper acknowledged al Qaeda was not a band on the run, as President Obama had described the terrorist enterprise, a report by terrorism expert Seth Jones of the RAND Corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the White House: As restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like Libya, Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring, those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al Qaeda and groups aligned with it. According to data compiled by Jones, from 2010 through 2013, the number of Salafi jihadist groups increased by 58%. These groups are fueled by Salafiyya Jihadiyya, an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al Qaeda, but is the source code for the agenda of the al Qaeda offshoot ISIS. Most recently, absent from the National Security Strategy produced by the Obama White House in February 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al Qaeda. Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed on President Obama's watch. But contrary to what the White House seemed to think in 2011, bin Laden's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over America's, or our allies' security. Indeed, within days of our new National Security Strategy's publication date, in the seventh issue of ISIS's English-language magazine Dabiq, the group's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin Laden, while accusing his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, of steering al Qaeda off the path of its former leader. Meanwhile, Yemen -- home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the al Qaeda branch that claimed credit for the January 2015 attack in Paris at the office of Charlie Hebdo -- has also become a failed state. AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda writ large, and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al Qaeda's global network. So it is interesting that, in the months before the Yemeni government was overthrown by Iran-backed rebels, President Obama described the U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al Qaeda -- interesting because the President did not do more to help that ""partner"" government remain in power. Once again, the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the Middle East. What were they thinking? And how do they plan to combat AQAP now? Despite what the White House wants the world to believe, a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities: . ISIS controls a large amount of territory in the Middle East, and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as Libya and Afghanistan, while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the West. And, although ISIS is trying to ""out al Qaeda"" al Qaeda, resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United States and our allies today than it was in January 2014. At the same time, the routine failures of President Obama and his advisers to understand the security environment, and to appropriately tailor America's national security posture in a manner demanded by it, foretells more disasters lie ahead. Not only Americans, but also our allies should be very, very afraid. Indeed, President Obama's refusal to simply call a problem like radical Islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical Islamist groups. History has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders don't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it. President Obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that. But if he wants to help define a future for the Middle East and North Africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions, he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes-men surrounding him at the White House. There is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with Pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe. Indeed, President Obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from Arab states are saying behind closed doors. Most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating ISIS and al Qaeda. However, all of them recognize that, unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better, the United States will have to deploy considerably more of our ""kinetic"" resources to put those victories in sight. This does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required from us at this time. But if the President thinks it prudent to wait on our Arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting, he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future.",162,12,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","islamic, terror, terrorist, al, threat, iraq, attacks, terrorists, terrorism, threats,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","terrorist attack, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threat, extremist groups","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about terrorist attacks, islamic terrorism, attacks on the country, terrorist threats, and extremist groups.","President Barrack Obama has failed to acknowledge how big a threat and problem radical islam is and has been to the United States and world.

On Wednesday, the jury deciding accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's fate were shown pictures of inside his family's Honda Civic as well as his older brother Tamerlan's wallet, which contained receipts for bomb-making ingredients. Tamerlan was killed in a dramatic shootout with police, but his brother escaped for several hours before being caught hiding in a dry-docked boat. Tsarnaev, 21, faces the possibility of the death penalty for his role in the 2013 deadly bombings. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon. On Wednesday, the jury deciding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty trial were shown pictures taken from inside his family's Honda Civic. They were also shown images of older brother Tamerlan's wallet (above) Observing: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (center) is seen in court on Wednesday in this sketch, as a fingerprint expert testifies . A bomb expert also testified in court on Wednesday, about the improvised weapons found at the scene of the Tsarnaevs' shootout with police in Watertown, days after the bombing . Members of the jury look at one of the unexploded bombs in court on Wednesday . Tamerlan's (left) wallet contained receipts from a gun and ammo store and for two backpacks at target. Defense attorneys for Dzhokhar (right) focused on the receipts in order to paint Tamerlan as the mastermind of the plot . Tsarnaev's lawyers showed the jury a photo of receipts Tamerlan had from a gun and ammunition store and for two backpacks and a soldering gun purchased in the days and weeks before the marathon bombings, apparently in an attempt to show that Tamerlan had a larger role in the bombings than Dzhokhar did. Also in the wallet was a MoneyGram receipt reflecting a $900 transfer to Russia by Tamerlan. But the prosecution made a case for Dzhokhar's equal participation on Wednesday, as they tried to connect him to the death of MIT police officer Sean Collier. The two brothers shot dead the campus police officer on April 18, after investigators released pictures of them as the primary suspects in the bombing. Two bloodied gloves were found near the gas pedal of the Honda Civic, and matched the DNA of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier . Fingerprints experts also revealed that Dzhokhar's prints had showed up throughout the Civic. It's still unclear whether he was driving the car that night . Forensics experts testified that Dzhokhar's fingerprints were found throughout the Honda. Jennifer Montgomery, a DNA analyst with the state police crime lab, testified Wednesday that blood was on a pair of gloves found near the gas pedal and driver's seat. The blood on the glove matched MIT police officer Sean Collier, but the defense pointed out on cross-examination that all of the blood tested on Dzhokhars's sweatshirt was his own. An MIT graduate student who was riding his bike by the scene of the shooting identified Dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into Collier's police cruiser the night he was killed. Collier was shot six times, including three times in the head at close range. While it wasn't determined in court on Wednesday which brother was wearing the glove, the chance that Dzhokhar was the shooter could damage the defense's claim that he was just following his older brother. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings but said his older brother was the mastermind in hopes of convincing the jury to give him a lower life-in-prison sentence as opposed to the death penalty. On cross-examination, the defense pointed out that none of the blood tested on Dzhokhar's sweatshirt matched Officer Collier . A MIT graduate student has identified Dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into Collier's car on the night of the shootout . After Collier's killing, the Tsarnaevs had a wild shootout with police in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the gunfight and being run over by his brother as he fled. Dzhokhar was found hours later, wounded and bloodied, hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. During earlier testimony Wednesday, jurors were shown two pipe bombs hurled at police during the shootout. Neither of those bombs exploded, but a third pipe bomb did. A pressure-cooker bomb similar to the bombs used in the marathon attacks caused a powerful explosion that shook houses on the street and sent debris raining down on police. Trooper Robert McCarthy also showed the jury a Tupperware container filled with explosive powder and fuses found in a car stolen by the Tsarnaevs just before the firefight with police. Testimony is scheduled to resume Thursday . The Tsarnaev family Honda Civic seen on the left. It was apparently first purchased by their father. Keys for the vehicle show a University of Massachusetts Dartmouth attachment. Dzhokhar was a student at the university when the bombings happened.

The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period but they go into Sunday's home game against Catalans Dragons with the best defensive record in the league. 'There's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team, we've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we've put some things in place to try and make that happen,' said Anderson. Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his Hudderfield side's misfiring attack to climb up Super League . The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period . 'We know what we're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run. We had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast. 'We've had some issues with our offence all year and I've got to take responsibility for that, because that's my role at the club, it's my job to try and fix it. 'If we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we'd have some serious issues. We just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it. 'If you look at the last three games we've lost, if we'd have got one more score in every game we'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we're dealing with at the minute.' A first win in four would enable Huddersfield to leapfrog their French visitors, who have won just one of five away games so far this year. Widnes are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the Select Security Stadium against Castleford in Sunday's other league game. Anderson says there is no hiding when facing Catalans Dragons, who have the league's best defensive record . The Yorkshiremen can climb to a season-high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and Vikings coach Denis Betts is expecting a stern test from Daryl Powell's improving side. 'Castleford have a solid squad who all know their jobs,' Betts said. 'They work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack.

An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country's bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly 450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of 200m payment on the 1st May and another for 745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended 240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (right) government has been talking with creditors since January . Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason. He said at a conference last week that Greece was 'not going to sign on the dotted line of anything you give us just to get the next loan tranche', 'At the very same time,' he added, 'we need to have a fiscal plan that makes sense. At the moment Greece is committed.' However,Greece's new left wing-led government which has been locked in strained negotiations with creditors since winning elections in January continues to hold its recent election victory over the international community. Varoufakis has said that Greece is committed to making its repayments and accepts the fiscal restrictions imposed on the country but within reason . Greece's defence minister Panos Kammenos, whose right-wing Independent Greeks party props up the country's socialist government, said they had a mandate to rule. 'Even if elections take place, we will double our share of the vote,' he told Greek TV. Greece has been given until 20 April to clean up its finances and set in place a number of economic reforms, necessary if it is to receive further rescue money. There is seemingly a great deal to be done if the country is to meet creditors' expectations.

387,3O7L7BFSHGRFI5TOZWCF7DK21N4EIJ,1dd00c89d71a5611797bb34da8a6eada8f058405,"(CNN)A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline: Mike Pence, a Koch Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him ‚î and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's ""cultural war"" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: ""We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women"" and later followed with ""There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America."" Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: ""It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli."" Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: ""I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage."" Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, ""the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment."" Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. ""We're winning,"" he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the ""we"" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, ""winning"" should not be mistaken for having ""won."" For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called ""religious freedom"" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, ""winning"" is going to feel very strange.",113,46,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.",Mike Pence was the Indiana state governor and was hoping to run for President in 2016.

One Twitter message said, ""If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada [martyrs]."" Another said, ""When you're a mujahid [violent jihadi fighter] your death becomes a wedding."" The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23. Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS. An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas, the FBI said. On March 26, Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona, with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States, the complaint said. It's not clear when or where she was arrested. She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.

A respected NatWest bank manager who was jailed for stealing £185,000 from his elderly customers to fund his internet gambling addiction will have to pay back every penny. Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man living near his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent, the Old Bailey heard. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole £185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. 'The benefit was £185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same', said prosecutor David Hughes. 'The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.' Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. 'If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.' Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today's hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: 'It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.' The court also heard statements from two of Mason's victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: 'I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.' Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting in Afghanistan . Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had 'an ongoing impact within the community' and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: 'You stole roughly £185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. 'Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. 'Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. 'You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. 'Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. 'I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. 'In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.' Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud.

Khaled Batarfi, a senior al Qaeda figure, was among the escapees, officials said. Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East. And while the conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi rages in the western part of the country, where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, controls parts of eastern Yemen.

Alexis Tsipras met the Russian President in Moscow yesterday and the pair agreed a package of investment in energy and other projects. But Mr Tsipras insisted he had not asked for ‚ or received ‚ financial aid, saying Greece is a 'sovereign nation' and 'not a debt colony'. Meeting: Greece's prime minister met Vladimir Putin yesterday and struck potential deals over investment in energy and other projects. It was expected Mr Tsipras (left) would ask Mr Putin (right) for a hand-out . Greece's government, the most left-wing ever elected in Europe, has been handed a list of reforms it must carry out in return for a new injection of cash from Eurozone countries. Propped up by some £175billion of aid from Europe and the IMF since 2010, Greece has not received bailout funds since Syriza took power in January, and could run out of money within weeks. It was expected Mr Tsipras would ask Mr Putin for a hand-out - despite Russia's economy also suffering deeply under Western and US sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea. But instead the meeting saw a commitment to restore trade between the two countries, which had been significant before both were hit by economic woes. The Greek Prime Minister said, defending his visit: 'Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy. 'Greece is not a beggar to go around all the countries asking them to help resolve its financial problems.' He said he would not be thrown 'off the boat' by the Eurozone, saying: 'We are equal passengers. There is no higher or lower deck. We are not a debt colony, we have the same rights as other countries have.' Moving forward: Mr Putin (right, with Mr Tsipras) said Russia could also provide loans for projects including a gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year as relations between Moscow and the EU deteriorated . Mr Putin said the leaders had discussed 'various ways of co-operating, including major projects in energy' and said Russia 'could provide loans' for projects including a potential gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year amid deteriorating relations between Mr Putin and the EU. 'This is not about aid but about financial cooperation in major projects‚¶.of course we are interested in pipelines, ports, and airports, as well as energy generation and other resources', Mr Putin said. Top of the agenda were restoring Greece's exports of food ‚ such as vegetables and cheese - which stopped after Moscow slapped an embargo on them, in response to EU sanctions. Mr Putin suggested this could be lifted, restore the livelihoods of Greek farmers. Experts said Greece could get a discount on gas ‚ most of which it imports from Russia. It is thought Mr Tsipras intended to ratchet up the pressure on his European creditors particularly Germany, to draw him away from Mr Putin's sphere of influence.

Natalie Swindells, 26, eats four bowls of the cereal every day. She can't face eating much else and has not tasted a vegetable for nearly two decades. The bank worker, who says she has never taken a day off sick, stopped eating most other foods from the age of two. She now believes overeating causes more health problems than having a very restricted diet like her own. In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner . 'I think doctors overestimate the amount of vitamins that we need to be healthy,' she said. 'I think it is about how much you eat, not what you're eating.' In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: 'It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet . She will also occasionally eat milk chocolate, ready salted crisps and chips. Although she consumes fewer than half of the recommended 2,000 calories for women Miss Swindells still has an active lifestyle. She lives in Macclesfield with her boyfriend Daniel Walsh, 26, who she says has grown accustomed to her strange eating habits. 'He's pretty cool with it,' she said. 'When we first got together he tried to make me eat different things but it didn't last very long. It was just pointless. Everything he made me try I didn't like.' In fact, the last time she tasted a vegetable was 18 years ago, when her mother tried to make her eat a roast dinner ‚ and failed. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: 'It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet.

Harry's Reid's perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats -- was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: ""I think Schumer should be able to succeed me."" That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer's rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the ""Wall Street wing"" of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate -- and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category. He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while Democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world's media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn't the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn -- before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer's). But Schumer's political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn't turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York's top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who is executive director of the state's Democratic Party. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, ""Positively American,"" which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters. Those who wonder what a Schumer Senate leadership would look like should take a look as Democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the Schumer era on Capitol Hill.",113,175,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.",In the Presidential election democrats will choose a new leader who walks through the ethical path.

The mile-high meals have seen highs and lows, from the first hot meals being served on United Airlines in 1936 and tablecloths and silver service in the 1950s to low-cost carriers slicing food budgets in the 1970s. KLM, the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands, has offered an insight into their airline cuisine in 1965. Passengers are served beverages by a flight attendant - with plenty of legroom - on a KLM flight in 1965 . In 1965, food was prepared on the ground, like today, by chefs, including many who had won awards . How the food was served . The 1950s and '60s were considered the golden age of travel, with the glory days of Pan Am, and the Concorde breaking records in the skies. From their promotional video in 1958 Pan Am unveiled the new developments on board their new 707 jet service. Meals were described as being prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, with dishes being cooked in five-minute ovens. In short - they aimed to take the 'travail out of travel.' The Civil Service for Aircraft Catering Provisioning was responsible for supplying food and beverage to KLM in 1965. By this time there were no chefs on board the flights, and thousands of meals were prepared on the ground every day. The provisioning came in the three categories. The fixed provisioning was the supplying of blankets, cutlery and glassware for guests. Meals and perishable goods were included in the variable provisioning, which depended on the number of passengers. Finally special provisioning was granted for specific dietary requirements and baby food. Passengers would specify their preferences before at the time of booking, and these would be relayed to the kitchen. The catering company for KLM and 20 other airlines cleaned 50,000 pieces of cutlery every day . What food was served? The Civil Service for Aircraft Catering Provisioning provided for around twenty other airlines, as well as KLM. In 1965, they would prepare tens of thousands of meals every day for flying passengers, which included pastries, roasted chicken and boiled eggs. There were kosher dishes served for those who required them, and a staggering 15,000 items of crockery to be cleaned daily. 3,000 cold dishes, fully composed . 250 chickens, roasted and deboned . 500 kilograms of meat, roasted or stewed . 3,000 eggs, boiled and shelled . 2,000 pastries . 250 kosher dishes . 10,000 trays, fully laid out . 15,000 cups, saucers and plates cleaned . 50,000 knives, forks and spoons cleaned . Concorde debuted in 1969, and flights on the British Airways and Air France dazzled guests with caviar, champagne, foie gras, lobster and truffles. Guided tours . Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has been KLM's home base since the airline's founding in 1919. The airport had kitchens for preparing flight meals, with many of the cooks having won international culinary awards. A highlight of the Schiphol tour would feature the cooking location, to see where the thousands of airborne meals were created. The big clean-up . According to old copies of KLM's staff magazine, Wolkenridder, the airline had 1.6million passengers during the fiscal year of 1964-65. Although this is not a lot compared to the 25.8million customers it carried in 2012, no disposable tableware existed in those early years, until 1969. Crews in 1965 would use a mechanised dishwashing system to clean all items, which had demineralised water, ensuring a no-streak finish. None of the plates, cups or cutlery were disposable on KLM's 1965 flights . What happened next? In the 1970s ticket prices fell dramatically with airline deregulation, and this had an impact on the budget for food and service. This sparked the creation of the world's first low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines, in 1971. In 1973, French airline Union de Transports Ariens recruited professional advice from Raymond Oliver, in redesigning their menus. Airlines begin to favour salty, rich and spicy food which is better for reheating and retains its flavour at 30,000ft. In 2001, after the September 11 tragedy, plastic cutlery was preferred by airlines. Another bomb scare in 2006 led to even stricter regulations with all liquids greater than 100ml banned from flights. This led to passengers being forced to buy drinks from the airport or expensive ones on the plane, unless they were complimentary. A report from TravelSupermarket reveals that airlines charge up to 2,600 per cent more than supermarkets for in-flight food and drink. In 2011 more airlines began to seek the help of celebrity and Michelin star chefs to raise the standard of in-flight meals. These included Heston Blumenthal, of Fat Duck fame, for British Airways, and Singapore Airlines sign-up Carlo Cracco, a two-star Michelin chef in Milan.",163,48,"airport, passengers, flight, travel, airlines, passenger, flights, airline, international, transport,","food, restaurant, eat, eating, babies, meal, drinks, fruit, breakfast, chicken,","travel via air, passengers on that flight, airlines offering flexible changes, world's busiest airport, international transport, flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers","eating food at a restaurant, a healthy meal, ordering something to drink, serving breakfast, fruits are a healthy food, eating chicken","This topic is about traveling via air, passengers on a flight, airlines offering flexible changes, the world's busiest airport, international transport, and flights being handled by different air traffic controllers.","This topic is about eating food at a restaurant, ordering something to drink and serving breakfast, as well as eating chicken, and fruits which are a healthy food.","Love them or hate them, airline meals are a big part of every traveler's flight and have changed drastically since their introduction in 1919.

'Deutsche Bank secretly conspired with its competitors to rig the benchmark interest rates at the heart of the global financial system,' said US Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer. 'Deutsche Bank's misconduct not only harmed its unsuspecting counterparties, it undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of financial markets everywhere.' German banking giant Deutsche Bank will pay $2.5 billion in fines for its role in a vast multi-year conspiracy to rig LIBOR interest rates, US and British authorities said on Thursday . The case centers on charges that Deutsche Bank derivatives traders manipulated the London InterBank Offered Rate, used to peg millions of interest rate-sensitive contracts and loans around the world, from at least 2003-2011 to boost their trading positions. Under the deferred prosecution agreement, Deutsche Bank agreed to plead guilty to a US charge of wire fraud, a criminal offense, in connection with the scam and admitted participating in price-fixing conspiracy with other banks. Deutsche Bank employees defrauded counterparties in emails, telephone calls and electronic chats, the US said. The $2.5 billion fine is a record for interest-rate manipulation. The largest German bank will pay $775 million in penalties to the Justice Department, $800 million to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $600 million to the New York Department of Financial Services and $344 million to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. The settlement agreement allows Deutsche Bank to keep its operating license in the United States. The Justice Department said the penalty reflected that Deutsche Bank's cooperation with the probe 'was often helpful but also fell short in some important respects.' Deutsche Bank co-chief executive Jurgen Fitschen has expressed regret for the rigging, adding that no current or former member of its management board were found to have known about the misconduct . Deutsche Bank co-chief executives Jurgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain expressed regret for the rigging, adding that no current or former member of its management board were found to have known about the misconduct. 'We have disciplined or dismissed individuals involved in the trader misconduct; have substantially strengthened our control teams, procedures and record-keeping; and are conducting a thorough review of the bank's actions in addressing this matter,' Fitschen and Jain said in a statement. The bank said it would book an additional charge of $1.6 billion in the first quarter for LIBOR and 'other matters'.",110,105,"billion, figures, economy, global, growth, economic, number, countries, numbers, expected,","charged, allegedly, charges, arrested, alleged, investigation, arrest, accused, authorities, office,","economic growth, global growth, billion dollar figures, economy is growing, expected growth","person arrested and charged, authorities allege, investigation, accused of a crime, under arrest on one charge, under investigation",This topic is about economic growth involving billion dollar figures showing that the economy is growing as expected globally.,"This topic is about a person arrested and charged, authorities allegations, an investigation, being accused of a crime, being under arrest on one charge, and being under investigation.",Deutsch Bank will pay a multi-billion dollar figure in fines.

According to data, analysed by Harbour Hotels, the average cost of property in London - a whopping £638,217 - actually falls below that of the Devon enclave. The seaside town in the South Hams district boasts a skyrocketing average property price: £671,759. According to new data, the average cost of property in Salcombe, Devon, now tops the average cost in London . This is more then the average cost of property in some of the UK's most expensive cities, including Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. And for those who want a room with a water view, that will cost you even more. The average value of a waterfront property in Salcombe tops £2million, putting it ahead of some of London's priciest postcodes, including Notting Hill and Regent's Park. In the west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, prices average £1,629,495, while Regent's Park comes in with an average property value of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath close behind at £1,270,274. In the pricey west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, property prices average £1,629,465 . Regent's Park comes in with an average cost of £1,338,467 and Hampstead Heath (pictured) at £1,270,274 . In Salcombe, property facing the estuary cost as high as £2 million, with non-sea views tallying £671,759 . Salcombe made headlines last spring when it was named Britain's most expensive seaside resort. Since then, property prices have continued to soar, increasing ten per cent in the last 12 months alone, which puts Salcombe's property market on par with London's 11 per cent yearly increase. Nearby seaside competitors, like Sandbanks, Aldeburgh and Padstow, however, have seen a dip in prices of about eight per cent on average. Property prices in Salcombe have soared 10 per cent in the last 12 months, while Padstow has seen an 8 per cent decrease . To visit Salcombe - without parting with millions of pounds - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel has rooms from £425 . With summer quickly approaching, many UK travellers will holiday in Salcombe to soak up a bit of sun and the million pound view. In fact, the most recent assessment places a view of the Salcombe estuary as being worth £1.3 million, given the average property cost of over £600,000 and an average waterfront property price of £2million. Known as 'Chelsea-on-Sea,' the idyllic waterside community is a yachting and sailing paradise, and home to fresh seafood and many stunning beaches.

And you can throw bottlers into that description as well. Of course Chelsea could implode and hand the title to Arsenal over the next six weeks or so, but that's unlikely. If it does happen it's a title that's long overdue and nothing can ever take away the barren years when Arsenal and Arsene Wenger were an embarrassment at home and abroad ‚ specialists in failure. Those years will always hang heavy around Wenger's neck. Yes, yes, there's the FA Cup currently sitting there in the trophy cabinet alongside the shiny shield they won in August. And yes, yes, they are clear favourites to win it again. An FA Cup isn't the definition of success for the great clubs of Europe. Only the Wenger apologists can't see that. Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's third goal by Alexis Sanchez in their win over Liverpool on Saturday . Arsene Wenger's Gunners now have 15 wins from 17 games since New Year's Day, but it's come too late . So are Gooners seduced by this end of season run they're currently on? It's impressive, no question. 15 wins in 17 games since their loss New Year's Day. But this is classic Arsene Wenger isn't it? After that defeat at Southampton on January 1 the Gunners were sixth in the table, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. Wenger and the players felt they had no hope of winning the title, and so they started to play with freedom, and the wins kept coming. As soon as the pressure is off, Arsene Wenger looks like he can still do it. But once the pressure is on he crumbles, and his players lose their bottle completely. Sanchez drills his shot by Emre Can as Arsenal's impressive run continued against Liverpool . Per Mertesacker can't stop this shot from Sadio Mane as they fall 2-0 to Southampton on New Year's Day . The only two defeats in this current run were the two key games all Arsenal fans desperately wanted to win ‚ at Tottenham and at home to Monaco in the Champions League: the two games with more pressure on them than any others on this run. They went to Monaco for the second leg with no pressure on them, everyone thought they were out, and so it proved. But with the pressure off, Arsenal turned it on. Arsenal are clearly a lot better than most of the teams they face. And they are now making the kind of signings they should be making ‚ marquee players. So much is in place for real success to come. But the task for Wenger now is to show some balls, cope better when the pressure is on. And he and his players need to stop failing in certain games. Harry Kane celebrates his second strike in the 2-1 win for Tottenham over their North London rivals . Dimitar Berbatov scores the second of three away goals for Monaco that ruined Arsenal's Europe campaign . Dodgy results will happen to all sides of course. But I'm talking about the ones that should have been avoided. This season for example, if they'd won a game they were winning at Swansea, if they hadn't been so desperately pathetic in the first half at Stoke, and if they'd kept the lead at 10-man Liverpool, Arsenal would be top. Those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points, have stopped Arsenal being serious title contenders this season. When you analyse it like that, you can understand the frustrations of the Arsenal fans after that Stoke defeat in December. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slumps to the ground as Arsenal bow out of the Champions League last 16 . Aaron Ramsey scores in the Gunners' 2-0 win at Monaco as they fell short again when it really counts . Arsene Wenger has been given time to fail repeatedly, and he's still there. He now needs to make the most of his incredible good fortune and start earning his £8m a year as the fourth-highest-paid football manager in the world. Winning games when the pressure is off is something Wenger has proved he can do regularly. Now he needs to learn how to cope and succeed when the pressure is on. If he does that, then there really is no reason why Arsenal can't win a major trophy, the kind of trophy that defines success for big clubs, and end an embarrassing period of failure for Arsene Wenger.",180,90,"goal, win, side, scored, minutes, goals, half, barcelona, points, match,","arsenal, ball, alex, wenger, villa, alan, cross, robin, darren, derby,","scored a goal, winning the match by a few points, scored before half-time, barcelona has minutes left","derby football match, Arsenal football team, they could have snatched victory, the team's former manager, the ball hit the post","This topic is about winning the match by a few points, and how Barcelona had minutes left and had scored before half-time but were able to score a goal at the end.","This topic is about a derby football match, in which the ball hit the post; according to the Arsenal football team‚Äôs former manager, they could have snatched victory, but the ball hit the post.","Throughout the season, a team will score goals, and will concede goals.

William Lindauer, 31, was taken into custody hours after the early-morning blaze on Nelson Street, Arvada on Tuesday, police said. He made his first court appearance in Jefferson County court on Wednesday morning. Jail records show he is being held on investigation of first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals and criminal mischief, ABC7 reported. His wife filed for divorce in October 2013 and it was completed on February 18, 2014, the channel reported. Property records list him at the address with Brianne Lindauer, 29. Neighbors said that three young children lived at the home but that they had not seen the woman or her children in weeks, ABC7 reported.

'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post. Crews were initially unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said. They also found a name had been painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire. After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps.

And like many others, they have come to believe that a private education is the best way to achieve it. But so desperate are they to get their son Craig ‚ known to them as CJ ‚ into a local prep school that they've put their house on the market in order to pay the fees. And that's not all. They've also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half, taken in lodgers, and have pinned their hopes on a 'crowd-funding' initiative, hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream. Scroll down for video . The Morgan family outside their home in Hastings with dad Craig, mum Bonnie and sons Craig Jr (known as CJ), nine, and Alfie, four. They are selling it for £185,000 to help pay for Craig Jr's prep school fees . 'We believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer,' said Mrs Morgan. 'There is simply no comparison.' The Morgans, from Hastings in East Sussex, settled on the idea of a private education for their children after CJ, who they say is academically gifted, found that he wasn't being stretched at his state primary school. 'We always knew CJ was very bright,' Mrs Morgan said. 'By the age of two he could recite the continents and at nursery he was identified as gifted and talented. 'By six he knew what every road sign meant and was reading paperbacks. Teachers say he is at least two years ahead academically compared with other children of the same age. And we've been told if he continues as he is doing with his maths, he is likely to gain a maths scholarship when he goes to senior school.' Despite his success at the local school ‚ rated as outstanding ‚ the Morgans felt he was too bright for state education and not achieving as much as expected. And then, they say, came a problem with playground bullying. 'He won a trophy for his go-karting hobby and after taking it to school he was constantly taunted by two boys,' Mrs Morgan said. 'He started coming home in tears. 'The final straw came when one yob yelled in his face and another punched CJ for nothing. The staff agreed it was an unprovoked attack but CJ no longer wanted to go to school. He started biting his nails and becoming withdrawn.' Battle Abbey School in East Sussex. 'Friends and family can't understand why we are giving up everything' to send CJ to the £4,000 a term school, says mum Bonnie . Heartbroken, the Morgans kept their son at home and contacted their local council to see if he could be transferred to a different primary school, but no places were available. Eventually in August 2014 ‚ and with CJ refusing to return to his state school ‚ he sat the entrance exam for Battle Abbey Prep School. Mrs Morgan said: 'He sailed through the exam and when we looked round the school, we all fell in love with it. There is a big emphasis on good manners there ‚ something that simply wasn't emphasised as important at CJ's old school. He loved it and in September started as a day pupil.' But at £4,000 a term, the fees were crippling for the family, particularly as their income depended on Mr Morgan's work as a taxi driver. However, having seen their son join the choir and become part of the water polo and hockey teams, all within just a term, the family decided to cash in the only real asset they possessed. 'Our net monthly household income is £2,300,' said Mrs Morgan. 'After bills and the mortgage have been paid, I'm often left with just £50 a week for food. But we just want the best for CJ. 'Friends and family can't understand why we are giving up everything. They think we are mad to pauper ourselves to give CJ ‚ and ultimately his four-year-old brother Alfie ‚ a private education.' As well as putting their house on the market, the Morgans have taken in a number of lodgers and have set up a 'gofundme' account in the hope of attracting donations of £115,000 from the public. Mr Morgan works as a taxi driver meaning the Bishop Abbey fees were crippling for the family, forcing them to sell their house, take in lodgers and attempt crowd-funding to afford them . 'Holidays are out and even day trips aren't possible as we can't afford the petrol,' said Mrs Morgan. 'CJ and Alfie have given up their bedrooms so we can rent them out. It means they have to sleep in the same bedroom as Craig and me.' Private school fees are a growing problem for parents, with those on middling incomes finding themselves increasingly forced out. Since 1990, fees have quadrupled, with the average cost of sending two children to private school now estimated at more than half a million pounds. Even so, figures from the Independent Schools Council suggest that demand for private education is increasing. Mrs Morgan said: 'The fees include extras such as some after-school clubs and trips. His uniform alone with its different pairs of sports shoes and PE kit cost us £500. We owe £9,800 on three credit cards but can only afford to pay off the minimum amount every month.' To help cut costs, the family's £120 weekly grocery bill has already been slashed to £50, thanks to bulk-buying and plenty of home-cooking. The Morgans have had to slash their weekly grocery bills by more than half to try and give CJ, and in future his brother Alfie, the private education they believe they deserve . 'Our clothes come from second-hand shops and we've even stopped the boys' pocket money,' Mrs Morgan added. Once their house is sold, the Morgans plan to rent a property, using about £85,000 of equity they have in their home to pay the fees. 'Ironically, as our mortgage is only around £200 a month and renting will cost about £1,000, it is going to add to our outgoings,' Mrs Morgan said. 'But this way we can sleep at night. We can clear our debts and, most importantly, pay for CJ's school fees. 'Of course some people's children are lucky ‚ they sail through a state school and go on to become lawyers or doctors. Everyone has a choice and some parents would simply not want to make the sacrifices we are doing. But, the facilities, the ambiance, the atmosphere ‚ it is all so much better than any state school. If your child is at a private school he is simply far more likely to reach his potential. 'Every day I pick CJ up from school he has a smile on his face. He is full of enthusiasm and inspired by his lessons. 'Craig and I will always know we did the very best we could.'

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said.

The former Obama administration official endorsed gay marriage in 2013 after she left the State Department, saying she 'was fully in support of gay marriage and that it is now continuing to proceed state-by-state.' And in a terse interview with NPR last year in which she declined to go into detail about her views on the topic, she repeated that position. Now a presidential candidate, Clinton today gave same-sex marriage her complete backing ahead of the presentation later this month of oral arguments in several cases before the Supreme Court on the matter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Now a presidential candidate, Clinton today gave same-sex marriage her complete backing. Her shift in position comes just before the presentation later this month of oral arguments in several cases before the Supreme Court on the matter . Clinton had brought attention to the issue with her campaign launch video on Sunday that featured 'everyday' Americans preparing for something big - including a gay couple planning their wedding . 'Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right,' Clinton spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod told a leading gay news publication, The Washington Blade. The shift puts Clinton's views in line with the Obama administration's Justice Department, which in January 'committed to ensuring that the benefits of marriage are available as broadly as possible.' Attorney General Eric Holder at that time said his department would file friend of the court briefs that 'urge the Supreme Court to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans.' 'It is time for our nation to take another critical step forward to ensure the fundamental equality of all Americans‚îno matter who they are, where they come from, or whom they love,' Holder said. Buzzfeed News earlier this week reported that the newly announced candidate's campaign had not responded to its requests for comment on the status of her views on marriage. Clinton had brought attention to the issue with her campaign launch video on Sunday that featured 'everyday' Americans preparing for something big - including a gay couple planning their wedding. The video also included an image a same-sex female couple snuggling on the couch as Clinton discussed families in a voice over. But it was only after fellow presidential contender Marco Rubio began taking flak for telling CNN on Tuesday that he believes that states should continue to have the final say on legalization of gay marriage that a staffer for the Democratic front-runner publicly announced Clinton no longer supports states' rights when it comes to same-sex marriage. 'Marriage laws have always been defined by the states,' Rubio had told CNN host Jake Tapper. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a roundtable discussion with members of the small business community at Capital City Fruit today in Norwalk, Iowa. Clinton is campaigning in the Hawkeye State this week as she makes her second bid for President of the United States . It was only after fellow presidential contender Marco Rubio, pictured here at his campaign launch on Monday, began taking flak for telling CNN that he believes that states should continue to have the final say on legalization of gay marriage that a staffer for the Democratic front-runner publicly announced that Clinton no longer supports states' rights when it comes to same-sex marriage . He added, 'I think there's still a significant number of Americans that believe that the definition of marriage should be that of one man and one woman, as it has been for thousands of years.' Tapper argued that 'they are a minority,' leading the Republican senator to contend that 'they're a large minority.' 'In essence, there are still parts of this country that believe that way,' he said. The exchange had started with Tapper accusing of Rubio of pigeonholing Clinton with his claims that she's a leader of 'yesterday' when he's the one who doesn't support same-sex marriage. 'You are casting yourself as a candidate of a new generation. But there is an issue where you are very out of step with younger voters, even younger Republican voters,' he said. 'On that issue, same-sex marriage, senator, you're the candidate of yesterday.' Rubio later said during the interview that the United States is a republic and anyone who want to see marriage laws amended should lobby their state legislature, not the federal government. 'I don't believe the court system is the appropriate way to do it, and I don't believe Washington and the Supreme Court is the appropriate way to do it,' he said. The nation's highest court will hear arguments on April 28 in gay marriage cases originating out of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. A group of 57 members of Congress earlier this month filed a friend of the court briefing asking the high court not to side with gay marriage proponents, saying, 'The relative novelty of same-sex marriage weighs against the mandatory redefinition of marriage.'

In recent advertising and in public announcement, Clinton moved her position to align with that of the Obama Justice department. Her newest positioning comes at a time when the question of the recognition of gay marriage is before the Supreme Court. Republican opponent Marco Rubio say the question should be handled at the state level, but Clinton says that this places Rubio out of step with the opinions of Americans.","There are several cases about to be before the Supreme Court on the topic of same-sex marriage.  The position of the Obama administration, who are ready to file friend of the court briefs, is that it is time for America to recognize at the Federal level the same marriage rights for same-sex marriages as for heterosexual marriages. Opponents argue that the matter should be addressed at the level of the states and the Federal court system is not the correct place for this matter to be settled. Opponents of legalization argue in support of the traditional definition of marriage, as a one-man-one-woman institution. and that the original definition should not be redefined."

New York Magazine called the show 'badly written' and 'frustrating,' while the New York Times said the production is 'largely made up of empty calories.'

Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.'

But it might take more than a slice of carbon fibre to protect Cesc Fabregas from what could be a quite hateful reception when he takes his first steps at the Emirates Stadium since he left to join Barcelona. That 2011 move was seen and widely accepted - externally - as the prodigal son going home. This next fixture is seen by some as the return of a player who rejected a second coming at Arsenal in favour of Chelsea. He will surely win the league, having already won the Capital One Cup, but what has he lost at the club that made him? What of the line of communication he once had with Arsene Wenger? Cesc Fabregas will be making his first return to the Emirates since leaving Arsenal in 2011 . The 27-year-old is expected to wear a protective mask when he travels to north London this weekend . Fabregas joined Arsenal as a teenager (left) before returning to the Premier League with Chelsea (right) Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger speaks to a young Fabregas after snatching him away from Barcelona in 2004 . It has been suggested they have not spoken since Fabregas made the summer move that got so many backs up. There is nothing terribly unusual in that except they used to be so close, to the extent that Wenger continued to text Fabregas on birthdays and career milestones while he was at Barcelona. 'He hasn't spoken to me since I came back,' Fabregas was quoted as saying in September. 'It was the kind of relationship I always would have liked to keep. 'But I'm sure once everything dies down a bit in the future we will talk. There is no problem. I'll always be grateful to him whatever happens.' Except there is still believed to be only silence from the man he once called his 'second father'. And for the first time, the Fabregas narrative is something less than delightfully romantic. Until now he had followed a largely clean script. He was the boy who attended his first Barca match as a nine-month-old baby with his grandfather. The tale of how he came to be their player 10 years later is wonderful. The story goes that he was playing for Mataro, 35km north of Barcelona. Rodolfo Borrell used to search the surrounding areas for young players for Barca's Under 11s side and one day watched Fabregas's team. Nothing to report. When he came back, two months later in September 1997, he saw a midfielder he simply needed to sign.

'I went to see them play again and suddenly I saw this one player who was simply wonderful,' he told the BBC. 'They told me he was called Cesc Fabregas and he was one year younger than the rest. He was good at running with the ball, had a fantastic pass over short, medium and long distances. He was very mature for his age and had all the attributes we were looking for at Barcelona at that time. 'At half-time, I asked the coach why I had not seen this kid before. He admitted that, when he saw me coming, he had decided not to play him because he knew that if I saw him I would take him.' He ultimately became part of a group that included Lionel Messi, coming through the ranks. His idol was Pep Guardiola and when Fabregas's parents divorced in 2001, Guardiola handed him a signed shirt with the message: 'One day, you will be the number four of Barcelona.'

The Arsenal playmaker scores a penalty against Braga in the Champions League in 2010 . Alas, he left for Arsenal in 2003 having not been picked for a single first-team game. By the time he returned in 2011, he had become Arsenal's youngest first-team player, their captain and a European Championship and World Cup winner with Spain. In 2005, aged 18 and with 60 first-team games already played, he told The Independent: 'I will always be a fan of Barcelona. But Arsenal gave me an opportunity. It's like you are standing at a station and there's a train that you must take. It's the opportunity of your life. 'At Barcelona, I was playing for the Under 16s. Here, they gave me the opportunity to play for the reserves straight away, soon the Carling Cup. It gave me the motivation that I needed. Now I want to improve, get more mature, get more experience.'

The midfielder's relationship with mentor Wenger became strained after he left Arsenal in 2011 . Six years on from that interview, he detailed his relationship with the club and Wenger as he explained why he was joining Guardiola's Barcelona. 'I only won one FA Cup really, and this is the biggest regret I will have in my career, probably, not to be able to lift a trophy as Arsenal captain,' he said. 'I will always be an Arsenal fan because what they have done for me is unbelievable and I will never forget it. 'Wenger is a special person to me. He'll always be a second father to me. I think if Arsenal want to keep being the club they are then they have to always be under his control, because he's the best, everyone respects him, and for me, he will always be the best person that I've met in football. 'I'll never be able to find the words to express my thanks for what he did for me.' Fabregas is given a hero's welcome on his return home to the Nou Camp with Barcelona .

Spain stars Andres Iniesta (left), Fernando Torres (centre) and Fabregas crash out of the 2014 World Cup . By that point, it would be hard to blame the rationale in wanting a move to Barcelona, but staff at Arsenal were disappointed in how the switch was pushed through. What followed was a three-season spell that has, perhaps, been unfairly characterised. The suggestion is that he under-performed at Barca, which in part is the fault of the club itself. Upon leaving last summer, the club, oddly, flagged up in an official statement that he tends to flag in the second half of seasons. They were right, as this campaign has proved, but it was unusual for a club to say so much. In any case, he won La Liga, Copa del Rey and Club World Cup winners' medals and in his second season, only Victor Valdes had more La Liga starts. It was not exceptional, though, and last summer came the chance to leave, bringing with it much of the confusion that still surrounds the midfielder.

The plague, which famously killed millions of Europeans during the Black Death, is most commonly carried by fleas and rodents. Prairie dog deaths at Picture Canyon in Arizona alerted officials to the possibility of an outbreak. Parasitic insects from the preserve near a water treatment plant in Flagstaff were found to carry the illness. Scroll down for video . Authorities near Flagstaff, Arizona, have found fleas infected with plague after prairie dogs in Picture Canyon began dying (file photos) The plague, which killed millions of Europeans in the 1300s, causes pustules on the skin and is still contracted by 2,000 people a year (file photo) Human cases have developed from close contact with cats who have preyed on infected vermin and residents in the Southwest have been warned about dangers of the disease while camping. The Southwestern US is similar to the plains of Central Asia where plague began, Professor David Wagner of Northern Arizona University told the Arizona Daily Sun. Plague is still contracted by as many as 2,000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 per cent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member. The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to drink, including from people. The vast majority of human plague cases reported in the US are in the arid climate of the Southwest, which scientists say is similar to the disease's homeland of Central Asia . The discovery of the disease at Picture Canyon (pictured) has prompted a warning from authorities about the dangers posed by dead rodents . Insecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread. Symptoms of pain in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain. At later stages it causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to seven days. Modern medications are effective in fighting the plague, also known by its bacterial name Yersinia pestis, though it can be deadly if left untreated. The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Plague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.

They can't keep on sacking managers.' Scholes, who was speaking on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, said United must be patient with the Dutchman but stressed that questions would have to be asked if the club were not challenging for the title next season. 'Maybe the coach does need time to settle in too, but the one thing he has got is (Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager) to help him settle and get him used to what to expect from Liverpool and from Newcastle,' he said.

It is claimed that Father John Lochran, 67, suddenly stopped Mass to rebuke retired psychologist Frances Haler, 87, who also suffers from leukaemia. The congregation at the Roman Catholic church looked on as the priest ‚ who denies the accusation ‚ told the octogenarian: 'Will you stop rustling!' A Catholic priest is being investigated after claims he halted his Sunday sermon mid-flow to berate wheelchair-bound Frances Haler (pictured with her granddaughter Alanna) for rustling her prayer sheet . After the service, Mrs Haler's daughter Toni Bewley said she confronted Father Lochran but he was said to have retorted: 'It's my church.' He is then said to have suggested the elderly lady take communion in her nursing home instead of his church. The incident at St Winefride's Roman Catholic Church in St Asaph in Denbighshire, is being investigated by the Bishop of Wrexham, the Right Reverend Monsignor Peter Brignall. Last night the pensioner's family condemned the priest. Mrs Bewley, 60, a college lecturer from Bodelwyddan in North Wales, said: 'Mum was really quiet throughout the service, and then I got the hymn and prayer book and all the bits of paper. Mum folded the paper in half and held it up close to her eyes. 'He looked up and said, ""Will you stop rustling paper and holding paper up ‚ I'm doing a sermon."" Thankfully, I don't think Mum realised. 'I was absolutely livid. At the end of the service I told him he had publicly humiliated my mother. 'He said he was in the middle of his sermon and he was in flow and it was disturbing him. Mrs Haler's daughter Tony Bewley (right) says she was left feeling 'absolutely livid' at the priest's behaviour towards her mother at St Winefride's Roman Catholic Church (left) in St Asaph in Denbighshire, Wales . Mrs Haler, who has chronic leukaemia and dementia, is pictured left, receiving an award and right, on her wedding day 60 years ago . 'I have got more Christianity in me than he has in his big toe. I've been left very upset. 'I just can't see what justification he had to humiliate her in the way he did. It's so sad, given dwindling congregation numbers, that he could be like this. 'It's made me question my faith. There's no way he can justify such an un-Christian attitude.' Mrs Bewley said her mother usually enjoyed the services because it helped with her dementia by allowing her to recall long-term memories. But trouble started before this particular service even began, when Father Lochran directed Mrs Haler to sit at the side of the church by the organ ‚ despite her being blind in one eye and partially sighted in another. When Mrs Bewley told him she would not be able to see the Mass, he allegedly responded: 'This is where she sits, this is my church.' The incident happened earlier this month when Mrs Haler was attending the Saturday evening Mass in a 29-strong congregation just 200 yards from the nursing home where she lives. Scots-born Father Lochran, who has been at the church for 14 years, said: 'For many years I was chaplain to pilgrims at Lourdes. I would never speak to someone with dementia like that ‚ and I didn't on this occasion.' A Diocese spokesman said: 'Bishop Peter has no comment to make until the issues have been thoroughly investigated.'

Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain's most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years' separation with consent; or five years' separation without consent. The second reason ‚ unreasonable behaviour' ‚ is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: 'We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.' Couples would have a one-year 'cooling off period' after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for 'no fault' divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: 'Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. 'Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce ‚î a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.'",115,46,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","Baroness Hale, supreme court judge, has suggested changes to divorce between a husband and wife. The judge believes divorce should be a more drawn out process so that it gives more time for family and friends to determine how assets and relationships will be divided equitably. For example, a couple going through divorce would not have to decide how to split time with the couple's daughter or the two brothers before the divorce is finalized in court. Sir Paul Coleridge, a former High Court judge, agreed with the Baroness, noting that the law is currently designed to create quick divorces with little regard to the ramifications.","A female supreme court judge in England has said that the federal law around divorce proceedings should be changed to make them less acrimonial. The judge suggests removing the need for allegations which specify why a couple would qualify for divorce in civil law. In addition, the judge believes the process of divorce should be more drawn out to give both parties in the marriage more time to decide on what happens with money and children. The current law for married couples does not require these items be finalized before divorce proceeds. The petition to change the state law was met with general positivity, although conservatives suggest it is not legal or fair."

Because you may not have any gefilte fish at your table on Passover, which starts at sundown on April 3. February's record cold temperatures are to blame for the shortage of fish ingredients, reported Erica Marcus, a food writer at Newsday, the Long Island, New York, newspaper. ""The traditional Passover appetizer is made from ground whitefish, carp and yellow pike,"" Marcus wrote. ""All three are freshwater fish from the Upper Midwest, and all three are in short supply this spring because the Great Lakes are still covered with ice."" While some restaurants reported having no supply issues, it may be a different story for the home cook. There's great debate within the Jewish community about the flavor of the classic gefilte fish dish, which isn't always the tastiest food at the table. ""I've never seen what all the fuss is about,"" Marcus told CNN. ""It's about as challenging a taste as tuna fish salad."" The fishing boats just can't sail or fish on frozen lakes. Many of the Great Lakes are still partially frozen over, according to fisheries expert Ronald Kinnunen, an educator with Michigan State University's Sea Grant Extension Program. ""Nobody's getting their fishing boats out,"" Kinnunen said. ""I'm looking at the satellite images and Lake Superior's half covered in ice,"" he said. It's still iced over at the Mackinac Bridge, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan come together at the Straits of Mackinac, he added. Blame an early Passover this year. Next year, it will likely be better for fishing. Passover doesn't start until sunset on April 22, much later in the month. The fish dish is not a religious requirement of the Seder dinner, but don't try telling that to cooks searching for the right ingredients for their classic recipes. If your mother or other host is mourning not having the dish at the table this year, offer to make chicken Kotletky or another offering from CNN Eatocracy's list of Passover recipes from around the world.",48,218,"food, restaurant, eat, eating, babies, meal, drinks, fruit, breakfast, chicken,","snow, weather, cold, winter, temperatures, conditions, hot, morning, expected, parts,","eating food at a restaurant, a healthy meal, ordering something to drink, serving breakfast, fruits are a healthy food, eating chicken","winter temperatures, hot weather conditions, a cold morning, snow is expected later","This topic is about eating food at a restaurant, ordering something to drink and serving breakfast, as well as eating chicken, and fruits which are a healthy food.","This topic is about winter temperatures as opposed to hot weather conditions, cold mornings, and weather forecasts like snow being expected later.","Erica Marcus, a food writer at Newsday, enunciated that there was shortage of fish ingredients for gefilte fish on Passover.

Arabtrust and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters Clubs say they are 'shocked' that 25 per cent of £6.3million worth of transfer fees for Ryan Gauld, Andrew Robertson, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. The supporters groups also disputed chairman Stephen Thompson's alleged level of investment in the club. The Dundee United board have hit back at criticism from supporters by pointing to their on-field success . The Tannadice club - already under fire for selling Armstrong and Mackay-Steven to Celtic six weeks before their League Cup final defeat to the Scottish champions - responded by defending their record in a statement. It read: 'All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club. 'This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field. 'On the field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. 'The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.' The supporters' joint statement expressed concern over the levels of club debts, saying: 'Despite the sales of the four players the board of DUFC does not believe that this is yet sufficient to pay all current remaining debt.' Defending their record on that point, the club statement responded: 'Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2m in February 2014 to £2.6m while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt. The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4m by the end of this year. 'Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters. They bring with them a wealth of experience in business. 'At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.' Arabtrust and the Federation also voiced concerns that chairman Thompson was wary of bringing in external investors for fear of seeing his family's shareholding drop below 75 per cent. The most explosive allegation, however, is the claim concerning the commission paid to outside parties ‚ none of whom are understood to be players, agents or other clubs. The supporters' joint statement added: 'We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25 per cent of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.' United last year announced that a recent debt settlement would see the Bank of Scotland collect a share of transfer fees received before the end of August 2015. A United spokesman said: 'We've been reluctantly drawn into this matter and have no wish to enter a war of words, but the £500,000 figure is an entirely fictitious amount based on an incorrect assumption.

All we're asking to do is to do half of that again.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the Tories have a secret plan to cut support to children. 'The Tories have a £12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it's clear they can't fill without hitting families with children. It's time for the Tories to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit.' The revelation comes after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm there will be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that' Mr Gove's remarks came after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government's austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 ‚ even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could 'rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you've already done in this Parliament?' But the Chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be 'depriving more families' of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: 'You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. 'We've got a track record, we've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.' Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: 'I've given you a very clear answer. We've created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. 'We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.' The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family's annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year.",247,200,"tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.","According to information from the head of government, Michael Gove, last night. conservatives could exclude the child benefit or prevent millions of families from receiving it.
 Rachel Reeves, Labor Secretary for Parallel Work and Pensions, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated blockade of scrapping child benefit cuts will only heighten fears that conservatives have a secret plan to cut support for children.
 Asked on BBC Newsnight if he could confirm that ""there will be no child benefit changes"", He said: ""No, I can't say"" Gove's statements came after George Osborne last month refused to rule out new benefit cuts child if the Conservatives win a second term.
 We've created a welfare system where child poverty has gone down, inequality has gone down, we have a record number of unemployed families and what we're doing is creating a welfare system where it's worth working and protecting the weakest.","Conservatives could block the child benefit or not let millions of families receive it, as the head of government, Michael Gove, admitted last night. Gove, the former education secretary, said he couldn't rule out further cuts in child support to reduce the deficit. Gove said conservatives would not block benefits for the disabled or retirees ‚î but refused to rule out child benefit cuts. He said: 'There is a huge amount of pension spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people with disabilities. Of these £12 billion would be blocked from the pension account, with the rest of government departments and even more measures against tax evasion."

Senators later voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran that the White House earlier implied may have been on the chopping block. It now goes to the full Senate, where it is could pass with a veto-proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers. The House's top vote counter on Monday said lawmakers in the lower chamber would also take up the bill after their colleagues in the Senate finished the voting process. Senators voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran that the White House earlier implied may have been on the chopping block . The Obama administration was in panic-mode this week, trying to strike a last-minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle that would satisfy its concerns with bill, which the White House had said as recently as yesterday that the president would 'absolutely' veto as written. While the legislative branch was in recess administration officials called 130 Members of Congress to try to persuade them not to act until the political framework that Iran agreed a week before firmed up. Officials ramped up their efforts in classified briefings with lawmakers today and yesterday. Among the White House's demands were that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drop from the bill a requirement to for Iran to certify that it has not backed terrorism against Americans, cut down a 60-day 'window for Congress to look over a deal and 'clarify' that it is the president's 'decision to make' whether or not to enter into an agreement with Iran. It also said it wants legislators to promise that the bill currently under discussion 'would be the one and only mechanism for codifying precisely what the appropriate congressional oversight is into this matter.' 'If we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. It is 'critical' Earnest said that the legislation that comes out of the Senate is bipartisan so that 'there isn't an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must-pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here.' 'And if presented with a compromise along the lines that I just laid out here, that would be the kind of compromise the president would be willing to sign,' he said. Earnest later indicated that the president's signature would be predicated on senators watering the bill down to just a vote to later vote on congressional sanctions and the inclusion of language that would make clear the proper role of congressional oversight. 'If the president were writing this piece of legislation it would look substantially different,' he said, noting that he didn't want to leave reporters with the impression that even in senators were 'willing to agree to this substantial number of changes that I've laid out here, that we're gonna be particularly thrilled about the legislation that emerges. 'I rather think what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the president would be willing to sign,' Earnest explained. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker, the author of the bill, center, shakes hands with the committee's ranking member Sen. Ben Cardin after the committee unanimously passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 . He later expressed concern that Republican members, if given a vote on the final deal, would be 'willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have' in favor of carrying out air raids on Iran, as former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton has suggested. 'Only' that kind of military action 'can accomplish what is required,' Bolton said in a March 25 New York Times op-ed. 'Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.' The bill's lead sponsor, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, during the hearing noted that as a result of 1600 Pennsylvania's last-ditch lobbying efforts, misinformation was circulating about the current language of the bill. 'This legislation is exactly the congressional review that we've been working on since day one,' he said, and had '100 percent of the integrity' senators on the committee hoped it would. Lawmakers did agree to take out the terrorism provision and to reduce the review period from 60 days to 30 days but refused to cut it out entirely. And sanctions that have been put in place, Corker explained 'cannot be lifted without the administration bringing to us every detail of the deal.' Then, he said, 'the clock will start' on the period of time Congress has to debate and decide if it wants to move ahead with a resolution of approval or disapproval - and in the meantime no sanctions can be lifted. And that's not the end of it, he explained, 'Congress stays involved.' Every 90 days, the administration would have to certify that Iran is in compliance with the accord, and if there are violations, the executive branch would have 10 days to notify Congress so it can reapply sanctions if necessary. 'So I think this puts Congress in its rightful role,' he said. The White House, sensing a legislative defeat was nigh, today said President Barack Obama would be willing to meet Congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with Iran if a Senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon. In the end, the committee decided to buck the White House . Pushing back on the administration's suggestions that supporters of the Senate legislation are warmongers, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, a key force in the bipartisan negotiations around the deal, characterized the claims as 'ridiculous' and 'offensive' during the committee meeting, . 'I'm pro-diplomacy...but I have also been strongly pro the need for congressional approval,' he posited. 'I actually think that congressional approval, in this instance under the framework that is now before us, is necessary, helpful and what the American public demands and deserves.'' Democratic Chuck Schumer, next in line for his party's top leadership role in the supper chamber, applauded Corker and ranking Democratic Senator Ben Cardin for coming to a bipartisan agreement on how to move forward. '‚éI'm certainly in favor of what they've put together,' he said, throwing his support behind the bill. New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker also lent his name to the legislation this afternoon, signing on as a cosponsor. 'The United States must do everything in its power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' he said in a statement. 'The framework deal with Iran is an important step forward in accomplishing this goal by diplomatic means. 'But as the body that imposed sanctions on Iran, Congress has a vitally important role in any process that seeks to modify them,' he added. 'The Corker-Menendez bill sets up a reasonable mechanism for Congress to have a voice in the process that will help make any agreement with Iran as strong as possible.' Fellow New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a namesake of the bill who temporarily stepped aside as ranking member of the committee as he deals with legal troubles, said he wanted to make clear with the committee's vote it never 'envisioned a wholesale waver' of nuclear sanctions 'without congressional input.' He was responding to Iranian leaders' affirmations last week that they would not accept a deal that does not immediately terminate sanctions. The Obama administration has repeatedly said that it only ever agreed to the phased lifting of restrictions on Iran and made that clear during the last round of talks. Menendez, speaking during today's hearing before the vote, said, 'Let's send a message to Tehran that sanctions relief is not a given' and it is 'not a prize for signing on the dotted line.' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, an original co-author of the legislation, said in a statement that 'Congress should have a say in lifting the economic sanctions which Congress created.' 'Every Member of Congress needs to listen, speak, and be accountable for what I believe will be one of the most significant foreign policy decisions our nation has faced in decades,' he said. 'Either with President Obama's signature ‚ or over his objections ‚ this legislation should immediately be pushed into law.'",175,162,"house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.",The senate and the president of the time were trying to reach a compromise over a bill that would include the presidents role in the nuclear deal with Iran.

A report from the House of Commons Transport Committee said the success of the UK's smaller airports are being held back by the existence of the APD, one of the world's heftiest departure taxes. The MPs said that Northern Ireland was suffering in terms of jobs, growth and connectivity as aviation taxes were higher than in the Republic of Ireland. And when APD is charged at both ends of a trip the tax 'incentivises airlines and passengers to fly from airports located in other EU member states', said the MP's report. The Scottish Government's plans to abolish the airport passenger duty could harm England's airports . The Scottish Government wants to reduce APD by 50 per cent in the next term of the Scottish Parliament and eventually get rid of it altogether in a bid to win the country's airports a 'competitive advantage'. However, there is no such commitment to axing APD in the rest of the UK, despite a decision by the Chancellor to abolish APD payments on children's tickets back in December. A spokesman for the campaign A Fair Tax on Flying, Stephen D'Alfonso, welcomed the report and called on the rest of the UK to follow Scotland's lead. 'We welcome the Transport Committee's report highlighting the detrimental effect that APD has on smaller airports, and the Committee's recognition that a lower level of APD in Scotland will have a negative effect on the rest of the UK,' Mr D'Alfonso said. 'With UK passengers currently paying one of the highest rates of tax on flying anywhere in the world, it is not surprising that the Scottish Government is committed to cutting this damaging tax. However, a cut in APD in Scotland needs to be matched by a cut in APD across the rest of the UK, so that no part of the country is disadvantaged in any way.' A report from the House of Commons Transport Committee said the success of the UK's smaller airports are being held back by the departure tax, which is one of the largest in the world . The report warned that if APD is scrapped in Scotland - the wheels are already in motion with the tax being devolved to Holyrood - 'airports in England would be subject to a similar competitive disadvantage to that currently experienced in Northern Ireland'. £26 per ticket to Europe . £69 per ticket to US, Canada, North and West Africa . £97 per ticket to Australia, Singapore and Indonesia . The abolition of the tax at Holyrood would bring £1billion into the economy by 2020 along with almost 4,000 jobs, according to a report commissioned by Edinburgh Airport. Plans to exempt children from APD, announced in the autumn statement of 2014, was 'a marginal change which did nothing for business travellers and little for smaller airports', the report added. The committee said: 'We found that APD is the principal threat to the smaller airports sector. 'APD cannot be amended to support people, businesses and regional economies because of the operation of European competition law, while proposals to devolve it to the regions would serve only to spread a patchwork of market distortions across the UK.' The report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from Newcastle, which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013, to Lydd in Kent which handled 1,000 . Launching the report today the committee's chairwoman Louise Ellman said: 'Smaller airports drive economic growth. But the smaller airports sector - which is vital to people and businesses in the regions - is limited by APD. Transport ministers must stand up for smaller airports and make the case to the Treasury that APD squeezes jobs, growth and connectivity.' She added: 'The whole country should share the economic benefits of expanded airport capacity. But that will only happen if new capacity includes new domestic flights to airports outside London. 'The Department for Transport needs to take a proactive approach and ensure that the regions are connected.' Scotland's Transport Minister Derek Mackay told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme found validation in the report and said they would do what was best for their airports. 'It does somewhat validate what we've been saying - that reducing air passenger duty would create economic growth in terms of more routes and sustain the lines that we have at the moment,' he said. 'That's why airports and the airlines have called within Scotland for the power to be transferred to us so that we can be more adept. Scotland's Transport Minister Derek Mackay said didn't mind that 'other parts of the UK may well be nervous but if we have the power then we'll use it to put Scotland at a competitive advantage' 'Some other parts of the UK may well be nervous but if we have the power then we'll use it to put Scotland at a competitive advantage.' The report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from Newcastle, which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013, to Lydd in Kent which handled 1,000. Airport Operators Association chief executive Darren Caplan said: 'The past few years have been tough for many of our smaller members. 'Reducing APD is the single biggest thing that could enable airports to attract new routes and increase their passenger numbers. APD is the highest aviation tax in the world and is increasingly putting the UK at a disadvantage.' A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'Regional airports make a vital contribution to the UK economy by boosting local jobs and providing important domestic and international connectivity. We want to help these airports thrive as part of our long- term economic plan, which is why we launched the Regional Air Connectivity Fund to support more new air routes. 'We are now assessing bids from airports and airlines for this funding and will soon announce a short list of routes, with a final announcement over the summer. 'We welcome the publication of the committee's report on smaller airports and we will study their conclusions carefully before responding in due course.'",163,247,"airport, passengers, flight, travel, airlines, passenger, flights, airline, international, transport,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","travel via air, passengers on that flight, airlines offering flexible changes, world's busiest airport, international transport, flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","This topic is about traveling via air, passengers on a flight, airlines offering flexible changes, the world's busiest airport, international transport, and flights being handled by different air traffic controllers.","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","The airport passenger duty (APD) tax makes air travel in the UK more expensive than other parts of Europe. In addition, the tax makes using small airports more costly. This can have an impact on jobs in this sector, as smaller regional airports can contribute significantly to the local economies by providing jobs and allowing access to local goods.","The airport passenger duty (APD) tax is having a negative impact on smaller airports in the UK. Changing the tax to make the smaller airports more attractive to carriers is complicated, as changes to the tax could hurt other areas of the UK if not implemented properly.  For example, if Scotland reduces and eventually eliminates the tax, nearby airports would see decreased traffic as a result. If a change in the tax can be determined, air travel in the UK will be less expensive and passengers could take advantage of smaller airports which could also help with congestion."

The Airbus A380, currently the world's largest passenger airliner, carries around 525 people. Scroll down for video . The Progress Eagle has three decks to provide capacity for more than 800 passengers along with beds and office space for crew members . The AWWA-QG Progress Eagle was dreamed up by Barcelona-based designer Oscar Vi±als as part of his vision for how travelling by air could be in 2030. His design uses six hydrogen fuel engines - one to drive a central screw-type engine at the rear to achieve the thrust needed to take off along with five superconductive engines. Capacity: 800 passengers . Wingspan: 96m . Length: 80m . Decks: 3 . Engines: Five superconductive engines . Other features: Solar panels on wings and rear engine that doubles as wind turbine . Once it reaches the right altitude, however, the central engine turns off and starts to generate electricity from the airflowing through it. Solar panels would also help to generate electrical power that the aircraft uses while it is in flight. Mr Vi±als said that the aircraft would produce zero carbon emissions and would also be far quieter than current airliners. Excess energy stored in the aircraft's batteries could be recovered by special electrical storage trucks on the ground when it lands. The cockpit itself is located on the second deck and includes beds an office and a workroom. According to Mr Vi±als the aircraft would be made from lightweight materials like carbon fibre, aluminum, titanium and ceramics. He said the wingspan would be 96 metres (314 feet) with the option of folding a section of the wings to make the aircraft easier to manoeuvre in airports. An Airbus A380 has a wingspan of 80 metres (262 feet) and a Boeing 747 is 64 metres (209 feet) across. The AWWA-QG Progress Eagle has solar panels on its wings and carries air turbines to allow it to generate its own energy while in flight . The huge 96 metre wide wingspan may cause problems when maneuvering on the ground in airports but Mr Vi±als says the wings may fold . Mr Vi±als said: 'The Progress Eagle is based in the technology beyond 2030 with ideas from quantum mechanics, if we consider the evolution of current technology and future progress in uses of theoretical physics solutions. 'Today we can find these technologies in the most advanced laboratories around the world (universities, private companies, government installations) and in the theories of the best scientifics. For these reasons, the innovations that the Progress Eagle presents could be available in fifteen years' time. The image above shows how, if it was to be built, the new Progress Eagle, would dwarf even the largest airliners used to carry passengers today . 'The most relevant aspects about this ""Super Jet"" would have a closer relation with quantum mechanics, we can simplify the airplane concept like a ""Mega"" energy's particle with special specifications more orthodox than we can found in today's physics.' This is the second concept aircraft designed by Mr Vi±als - last year he released designs for the AWWA Sky Whale, with a wingspan of 88m. He said the Progress Eagle is more of a big brother to the Sky Whale. The design features a single rotating engine at the back of the aircraft which would combine with other engines under the wings to provide thrust .

Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video . As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy . 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight. According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females . The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp. Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females. The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese.

The potential Republican presidential candidate then used the example of prisoners to provide support for his statement. 'Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight ‚î and when they come out, they're gay,' said Carson. Scroll down for video . Ben Carson (above) said in an interview on Tuesday that he believes being gay is 'absolutely' a choice . The comments were made during an interview on the CNN program New Day when host Chris Cuomo asked the retired doctor if he did in fact believe that being gay was a choice. Carson followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay. 'So did something happen while they were in there?' he said. 'Ask yourself that question.' He then went in on the issue of gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights -- property rights, visitation rights,' he said. 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' For this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson is in favor of civil unions. Carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. So he, it's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews. The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.",46,113,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","Fewer than a dozen states and the District of Columbia recognize common law marriages.

Steven Nelms writes in the essay's introduction that he can't afford his wife to be a stay-at home. 'I don't at all mean to offend anyone with this post,' he writes. 'I'd like to explain exactly what that means so that no one thinks I'm in any way devaluing Stay-At-Home Moms.' Steven Nelms penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother to their two-year-old son Ezra . 'On the contrary, I mean that I quite literally cannot afford my wife to be staying at home.' Nelms told the Independent Journal Review that his wife, Glorianna, stays at home with the couple's two-year-old son Ezra because of high child care costs. But Nelms said working has always been a part of Gloriana's life, who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family's income when she was 17. 'Getting a paycheck was significant part of feeling valued and appreciated for all the hard work she did to provide for herself and help her family,' he sad. So Nelms, from Plano, Texas, decided to write an essay, which was posted on We Are Glory, in which he would break-down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family. 'Yes, my wife is my son's mother and it is a natural result of being a parent to love and care for your own child,' he writes. 'There is also a very quantifiable dollar amount that can be attributed to the services rendered.' 'I am in no way trying to simplify, objectify, or devalue the priceless love of a mother for her child,' he wrote. 'But let's be real. Pay day feels good for a reason. Because you're seeing your hard work appreciated in a tangible way that lets you ""treat yo self""'. In the essay Nelms says he 'can't afford' his wife to be a stay-at-home mother, and then breaks down the monetary value of all that she provides. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes . Nelms said that he felt 'ashamed' for every time his wife felt she didn't have 'as much right to our income as I do' and that his income 'doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family' Nelms estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $36,660 a year, the annual-salary for a full-time nanny. He also estimates this his wife does $5,200 worth of cleaning a year, $12,480 of cooking, and $13,520 for buying groceries and running errands. After adding that his wife helps deal with the family's finances and does the laundry, he concludes that his wife's annual salary should be $73,960. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes. 'In short, I can't afford for my wife to stay at home. And I've tragically failed to show my wife the appreciation that she deserves.' Nelms admits in the essay that he has felt 'ashamed' every time he has ever made his wife feel guilty of humored when she has bought something for herself. 'I am ashamed that she has ever felt like she doesn't have just as much right to our income as I do. The fact of the matter is that our income doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family.' 'She loves me, loves our son, and loves our family, so obviously she isn't doing any of those things for a paycheck or even for recognition.' 'But it certainly doesn't hurt to know that as a Stay-At-Home Mom her appraised salary is nearly double my actual income.' Nelms concludes the essay by telling his wife 'you are more precious than rubies.'

He feels bad about not having more to give to his wife and writes that he needs a better income to be able to afford everything she does for the family.,The man writing the article is praising his wife for being such a great stay at home mom. He is saying he cannot afford to spend the money she deserves for working for him. He writes an article on how much each service his wife is provided would cost and how much he would have to be making if he wanted to pay her for what all she is doing. He writes about how often she feels like she does not have a right to their shared income but he calculates that she has more right to their income than she knows.

All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives. The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany at more than 400mph. 'We were supposed to have been on that flight. We checked in with all of the passengers. It's surreal,' Dalkurd FF's sports chief Adil Kizil told Aftonbladet.

Mr Kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the Germanwings flight, but that the connection time in Dºsseldorf to continue their journey home to Sweden was too long. Instead they split the team onto the three other flights, with one group flying via Mºnchen and two others via Zºrich. Mr Kizil said the players are still shocked, and that their thoughts are with the families of the victims. 'All the people on that plane were at the same check-in as us.

Some members of the terrorist cell had direct contact with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before his death in Pakistan in 2011, wiretaps showed, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported. And wiretaps and other intelligence revealed that the group planned to carry out terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in Italy, according to Caligari Chief Prosecutor Mauro Mura. Some evidence indicated the Vatican was among the targets considered, police said. Talk of this took place March 2010, around the time a possible suicide bomber from Afghanistan entered Italy, Mura said. Police said, too, that some of the suspects were involved in a Pakistani market bombing in 2009 in which more than 300 people were killed and injured . The suspects had been under surveillance for years, some as far back as 2005, police said. On Friday, Italian State Police closed in, carrying out raids in seven provinces in what they called a first-of-its-kind operation. One of the raids targeted the alleged terrorist cell's headquarters on the island of Sardinia. The operation, which is still going on, is expected to result in the arrest of 18 people, most of them from Pakistan, said spokesman Paolo Meloni, who represents the police in Sassari, Sardinia, where the investigation is being coordinated. Some suspects had an abundance of weapons and moved cash around the world, police said. One was apprehended on a flight from Italy to Pakistan while carrying 55,000 euros, or nearly $60,000, police said. Meloni said the provinces in which the raids were being carried out included Frosinone and Macerata, which are in central Italy, as well as Bergamo, in the north. Some of those expected to be arrested are suspected of having been involved in the 2009 car bombing in Pakistan, Meloni said. In that bombing, in a bazaar in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 137 people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Still other suspects are suspected of involvement in migrant trafficking, he said. Police said the group tried to recruit to its cause the migrants it transported.

Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome.

Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by.

So far, the star is proving to be Camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the British ambassador's residence in Washington D.C last night. Resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by Bruce Oldfield and her trademark pearl choker, the Duchess of Cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of Prince Charles. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Camilla in a chic Bruce Oldfield gown during a banquet on the second day of the US tour . Looking good: The Duchess has also used the occasion to show off a chic new haircut . But Camilla isn't the only one who has proved a hit with the US public, with Charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of Washington's many monuments yesterday. Arriving to cries of 'Welcome your Highness!', a clearly delighted Prince of Wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the Lincoln Memorial. Not everyone knew who they were however, with one little boy asking his mother: 'Who is that man?' 'The future King of England,' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iPhone. Charles and Camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post. New name: The royal couple have been re-christened 'ChaCam' by the local media . Warm welcome: Both Charles and Camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people . In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don't get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it's still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father. But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least. That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. 'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said ahead of the royal couple's arrival on Tuesday night. Looking around: Charles and Camilla spent their first full day touring Washington D.C . Star of the show: Camilla, who is clearly been enjoying the tour, has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome . Smile! Yesterday, the Duchess obligingly posed for a selfie outside the Lincoln Memorial . Cheering for Charles: Local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the Lincoln Memorial . 'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.' Much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries, among them the 800th birthday of the Magna Carta and the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Both were ticked off the list yesterday, with Charles and Camilla starting the day at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and, in Charles' case, ending it at the National Archives for a viewing of the 1297 Magna Carta. Today's schedule, which, if yesterday is any indication, will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press, will see 'ChaCam' visit President Lincoln's cottage in Washington D.C. Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office. President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.

He did similar at Villa Park, rousing himself after three missed chances to bury the winner in the closing stages. Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, believes that goal, following a brilliant Jefferson Montero cross, showed his striker is ready to fill the void left by Wilfried Bony and replicate the kind of form he enjoyed at Lyon. Bafetimbi Gomis scored a late winner as Swansea beat Aston Villa 1-0 at Villa Park on Saturday . Gomis (second right) celebrates with a rogue Swansea fan who made his way onto the pitch . Every time Bafetimbi Gomis has scored this season, Swansea have won . 'We know what the headlines would have been if we didn't win that game,' said Monk. 'But Bafe didn't let it affect him when he had those chances. He persevered and deserved that. His commitment and effort in recent weeks since Bony left has been top.' His strike against Villa was his third Premier League goal of the season, even if all have been late winners. It was his 27th game in the English top-flight but only 14th start. For Tim Sherwood, defeat punctured some of the building optimism around his tenure. The Villa manager insisted the club would not creep back into the 'depression mode' he encountered on arriving however. 'The morale was very low when I came in. They were on the floor,' he said. 'I think that's turned around now. I'm still confident even after this little blip that we'll stay in the division.'

Dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the Harbour city, a record growth and the strongest increase since April in 2009, according to the latest figures from RP Data. It comes after the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates to 2.25 per cent in February, leading to a weekly 80 per cent auction clearance rate and an investor fuelled market. Scroll down for video . Sydney's dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the last quarter bringing the average median house price to $690,000 . It's thus no surprise to see properties across the capital city sell for well over the $1 million mark like this Ryde residence in Sydney's north west which sold for $1.8 million on the weekend . Set on 565 sqm, the four bedroom property features a deluxe spa bath, two terraces, three bathrooms and a fireplace . 'Although household income growth is minimal, Sydney's housing market continues to reach new record highs, with values increasing over the past 35 months,' Tim Lawless, the head of research at CoreLogic RP Data, said. 'It does pose the question of how much longer the growth can persist.' Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter. 'Although value growth has started 2015 on a strong note, the annual rate of growth has moderated back to 7.4 per cent, which is the slowest annual growth rate since September 2013,' Mr Lawless said. This five-bedroom home at 39 Holmes Street, Maroubra in Sydney's eastern suburbs sold for $2 million on Saturday . Across two levels it features open plan living areas, a chic kitchen with stone benches and three bathrooms with a stand-alone bath . Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter . 'Despite the headwinds of softer labour markets, very low rental yields, increased oversight on lending conditions and heightened economic uncertainty, historically low mortgage rates appear to be adding further stimulus to the housing market, albeit that stimulus is largely being felt in Sydney.' The median house price across the combined capital cities is now $530,000, with Sydney being the only city to surpass the figure with a median of $690,000. Canberra surprisingly performed second best to Sydney over the quarter with a 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling values leading to a $530,000 median house price, followed by Melbourne at 3.5 per cent and $518,000. The remaining capital cities were all under 1 per cent with Hobart at 0.9 per cent and Darwin at 0.4 per cent. Perth took out the last place at -2.7 per cent despite beating Hobart and Darwin over the year. This five-bedroom home at 95 Chelmsford Street, Newtown in Sydney's inner west, sold for $2.3 million on Saturday . It has four levels on 290sqm with high ceilings, three bathrooms, courtyard gardens and a self-contained studio . The median house price across the combined capital cities is now $530,000, with Sydney being the only city to surpass the figure with a median of $690,000 . Canberra surprisingly performed second best to Sydney over the quarter with a 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling values leading to a $530,000 median house price . Hobart has maintained its position as the most affordable position by a longshot, with a median dwelling price of just $310,000. Mr Lawless offered a word of caution to investors with their eye on Sydney however, suggesting the market could soon begin to 'lose momentum'. 'There is some risk that recent investors could be left holding a very expensive but low yielding asset with a lower than expected rate of capital gain over the coming years,' he said. 'From there it will be interesting to see if they bide their time in the housing market or exit to other asset classes with a stronger return profile.' This home at 260 Holden Street, Ashbury in south-western Sydney, sold for $1,781,000 over the weekend .

It lets people take old handsets into a store and get credit to put towards the purchase of a new one. These handsets can be recycled online too, and Apple offers an iPad version of the scheme. The amount of credit depends on the device and its condition, and its likely that figures for Android handsets, which are typically much cheaper than Apple phones, will be low under the scheme.

Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn't matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as 'fuel' - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn't matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn't do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements.

454,36AHBNMV1TEWGZUT7JNYNJW5THKDYQ,7ee19ff0875fcbd8b74442a73a513658fec4f9f3,"An assistant school principal in Texas has received a lenient sentence after admitting to sneaking off with an 18-year-old student during a prom event in 2012 and having sex with the girl in his office. Light sentence: Mark West, 32, will serve four months prison and eight years probation for having sex with a student in 2012 . Mark Steven West, 32, who is married with a child, was sentenced Tuesday to four months in jail followed by eight years probation after pleading guilty to the improper relationship while working at Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He had previously said the girl instigated the moment, seducing him by saying she was 'feeling horny'. The girl admitted as such to police also, telling them she encouraged West to have sex. But despite the light punishment, the judge was scathing in handing down her punishment, saying that just three weeks after the incident the girl graduated, which would have made their encounter legal. 'You did it because you enjoyed the attention of young girls,' State District Judge Catherine Evans said, according to The Chron. 'We're talking about a razor thin margin of three weeks between what separates a felony crime from a poor decision to have an inappropriate extramarital affair.' State law prohibits educators having sex with students. West apologized to the court, saying he made 'bad decisions made on impulses' and was being 'selfish'. School officials were first tipped off to the allegations after hearing rumors and seeing inappropriate interactions between West and certain students at the school on separate occasions, according to court documents. He tickled one girl, lifted up another, and was accused of making inappropriate comments to two others. West was interviewed by a senior staff member at Spring High School in Texas in December 2012 after administrators heard that he made a sexual remark about one female student and possibly had sex with another. He was also investigated in the 2011-2012 school year for inappropriately touching a female student on her lower back. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence but he was ordered not to have any contact with female students. One staff member said she was extremely uncomfortable by the number of lengthy 'closed door meetings' West was having with female students. The staff member said she observed students leaving his office, smiling and laughing, with their clothes and hair disheveled. Scene: West has resigned from his post as assistant principal at Spring High School, Texas, after the incident became public. He eventually pleaded guilty and no longer works as a teacher . She also saw West 'body slam' a female student, in a playful manner, on a couch in the lobby office. Students told investigators about rumors that West had sex with a student at the 2012 Project Prom event. The woman, who is now at college, told investigators she seduced West. She told investigators that she came on to West first and that he initially refused her advances, according to court documents. She said she started to flirt and talk with West, allegedly telling him that she 'was horny and wanted to have sex with him'. The woman said she continued her advances until he agreed to meet her in his upstairs office. Once alone, the two of them began to kiss and then had sex, investigators said. West denied having sex with the student, but authorities felt they had enough evidence to file charges. He was placed on administrative leave and then resigned. While he maintained his innocent for some time, West finally admitted what he had done and pleaded guilty. Spring High School Principal Donna Ullrich issued a statement to parents, writing at the time of West's arrest: 'I want to assure you that the safety of our students is of the highest importance at Spring High School. 'The criminal history and references of job applicants are routinely checked before they are hired. 'The administration at Spring High School takes every allegation seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation and expose inappropriate behavior when necessary.' West's wife testified at his hearing that he is still not working as a teacher. The prosecution had pushed for a much higher sentence, reiterating that he was not just a teacher, but a principal. West does not have to register as a sex offender.",195,196,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","school, schools, teacher, high, education, parents, teachers, hughes, children, students","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","high school teacher, high school students, education in schools, parents meet teachers, children going to school","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about high school students and children going to school, education in schools, and parents meeting teachers.","The fiery crash that brought down a Concorde supersonic jet in 2000, killing 113 people, was caused partially by the criminal negligence of Continental Airlines and a mechanic who works for the company, a French court ruled Monday.Continental Airlines was fined 202,000 euros ($268,400) and ordered to pay 1 million euros to Air France, which operated the doomed flight.Mechanic John Taylor received a fine of 2,000 euros ($2,656) and a 15-month suspended prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter.The aircraft manufacturer EADS was also found partly responsible for the crash and ordered to pay 30% of damages to victims involved in the case.Air France has already paid an unspecified sum in damages to the families of most of the victims of the only crash ever of a Concorde.","High school teachers teach academic lessons and various skills that students will need to attend college and to enter the job market.High school teachers work in schools.

A war veteran who swapped the battlefield for a 'dull' job as an army recruiter 'raped young hopefuls because it made the job more exciting', a court heard today. Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power while interviewing applicants by raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces. The officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011 at an Army careers centre in Croydon. The alleged victims, who were desperate for jobs, were often new to the country and unaware of their rights, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mee, who has served in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration relating to 11 young cadets. Jurors were told earlier in the trial that one of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant after Mee raped her in a locked waiting room. An 18-year-old from Sierra Leone also claimed Mee raped her after saying he could help her get a visa. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested 'risk taker' Mee who has fought in war zones across the world found interviewing recruits in Croydon 'dull'. 'But if he could use his position and manipulate it to take small risks at first and then bigger ones, it would make the job that much more exciting,' she said. 'Bullying, talking dirty to the young women, smacking bottoms and ultimately raping young women - he got away with it for a year or more. 'He obviously believed he would never get caught.' She said Mee believed he was the only 'real soldier' at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon, south London. 'This case starts and finishes with Sergeant Jock, are you sure that he behaved the way the prosecution said or not - he is right at the centre of it all,' she said. He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . 'He, of course, says he didn't do any of the violating, bullying and humiliating acts alleged against him. 'But there appears to be no good reason, or any reason, why any one of these women would lie - let alone 11 of them. 'What have you made of the evidence he gave and of the man whom you are going to be sitting in judgement? 'He is a man who is proud of his record in active service.' Jurors were told Mee thought little of his fellow recruiters, even if they were senior to him. 'He was the real soldier, he was the one who believed that he had the right to recruit those who would join the British Army,' said Ms Cottage. 'You may feel that was his attitude. With his promotion towards the end of 2010 did he come to believe in his own importance? 'Was he arrogant enough to believe that when he behaved in the way he did again and again with woman after woman that he had become so important within that office that they would not complain and even if they did, nobody else would believe them?' Mee, originally from Glasgow, joined the army when he was 24 and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial continues.

But 10 years on from the sunny April day that saw Camilla Parker-Bowles become the Duchess of Cornwall, things are looking very different for the 67-year-old royal. Indeed, so popular has Camilla become, a recent poll revealed that not only is the Duchess loved by 50 per cent of Britons, 56 per cent credit her with Charles' own increasing popularity. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since marrying Camilla . Still in love: An intimate photo released today to mark their 10th wedding anniversary . More to the point, she has also become a much-loved member of the Royal Family, adored by her step-sons William and Harry and noticeably close to her mother-in-law, the Queen. That her relationship with the rest of the Firm is so good is due, in no small part, to her 'charm and charisma', both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with CNN. The natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the Royal Family, with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public. Most recently, she pulled off a tour of the US with aplomb, charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home. Her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month's Cheltenham Festival where, accosted by ex-glamour model Katie Price in the paddock, she posed obligingly for a selfie. A few minutes later, she was seen engrossed in conversation with author Jilly Cooper, who memorably based the caddish Rupert Campbell-Black, the star of the much-loved Rutshire Chronicles, on Camilla's ex-husband Andrew Parker-Bowles. Sharing a joke: Camilla and Prince William share a joke at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games . Natural warmth: Camilla's success is due to her charm - on display here during last month's Cheltenham . Involved: Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at the 2011 Royal Wedding . 'She is warm, smiley and sincere,' reveals one Royal insider. 'If you were going to use five words to describe her, they would be funny, down-to-earth, opinionated, family-orientated and hearty.' But Camilla's new-found confidence is hard-won. A salt-of-the-earth countrywoman who, given the opportunity, would happily go make-up free and avoid set-piece events, taking on the very public life of a senior royal hasn't been easy. That she has managed it, apparently without breaking a sweat, hasn't gone unnoticed - not least by Prince Charles himself. 'You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,' said the prince in the same CNN interview, adding: 'But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things . insiders say the transformation is less about careful PR work and more about Camilla herself - in particular, the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart. One of the first to benefit was the National Osteoporosis Society, with whom the Duchess has been involved for more than 19 years. 'Throughout our association with the Duchess, she has been unwavering in her support,' says Chief Executive Claire Severgnini. 'She is personable, knowledgeable and compassionate.'

Approval: A clear sign of approval is the regularity with which the Duchess appears alongside the Queen . Shared interests: Both Camilla and the Queen share a passion for all things equestrian . Her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the Duchess. In 1994, aged 47, she was forced to watch as her 'beloved Mama' Rosalind Shand died, slowly and in agony, as a result of the disease. Indeed, the Camilla's association with the charity pre-dates her marriage, with the Duchess first getting involved while still Mrs Parker-Bowles. Asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy, biographer Penny Junor writes that she was initially reluctant, fearing she might do more harm than good, before agreeing to get involved. Although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by Princess Diana's tragic death, she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events. She has also made a name for herself as a champion of women's rights, becoming deeply involved in the UK's rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women's refuge part of every international tour. While visiting Colombian capital Bogota last November, she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center. Having a laugh: Camilla, Harry and Kate share a joke on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in June 2013 . Friendly: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a friendly relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge . All smiles: The pair were frequently spotted together during the London 2012 Olympic Games . In Washington last month, the Duchess left Prince Charles to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the District of Colombia's Sexual Assault Response Team. Camilla's increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears, with the frumpy get-ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still-trim waist. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she's never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five-strand pearl chokers. In the country, she likes tailored tweed suits by Roy Allen, one of her favourite couturiers, cosy coats by Swiss label Moncler and flattering hats by London-based milliner, Lock & Co. But as the Duchess of Cornwall prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, it is the sea-change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling. Mirror image: The two also share a similar sense of style - including a penchant for nude pumps . Cheers! Meanwhile Camilla's relationship with Prince Charles has gone from strength to strength . Charm: The Prince spoke glowingly of his wife's 'charm and charisma' in an interview last month . Not only is she close to the Queen, who was once reported as wishing she 'would just go away', Camilla is also adored by Diana's sons William and Harry - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of September's Invictus Games made only too clear. 'Having initially loathed her, the Queen gets on well with Camilla now,' adds the insider. 'She isn't as close to the Queen as Sophie [Countess of Wessex] is but that is partly because the Queen's relationship with Charles is a bit complicated anyway.' What certainly isn't complicated is Camilla's relationship with Charles. Despite such quirks as maintaining separate country homes, after 10 years, the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever. Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an ""Enid Blyton sort of Childhood"",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help ‚ help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fte. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.",115,211,"family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","london, british, uk, britain, royal, prince, william, harry, england, princess,","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, British royal family, second in line to the throne, the royal couple","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","This topic is about heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, the British royal family, the second in line to the throne, and the royal couple.","The most common punctuation marks in English are: capital letters and full stops, question marks, commas, colons and semi-colons, exclamation marks and quotation marks.

Mark Donaldson is one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers, one of the very few to have been awarded the nation's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, for his bravery in Afghanistan. Corporal Donaldson VC revealed in 2013 how four years earlier he had been a member of an elite Special Air Services unit ordered to assassinate a Taliban warlord who had boasted that he intended to kill Prince Harry. To kill a prince: Captain Harry Wales (pictured on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan) was the target of a Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin who had boasted he would kill the royal heir but was shot dead by a crackunit from the Australian SAS, where Harry is headed next for the final chapter of his military career . Hunted down: Corporal Mark Donaldson VC, one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers is pictured in Afghanistan where he and fellow SAS troops hunted down and shot dead the Taliban warlord who had boasted of killing Prince Harry . Valour under fire: Mark Donaldson (pictured, right, with fellow troopers in Afghanistan) was awarded the VC for his actions in September 2008, when, despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue a wounded interpreter, while under heavy machine gun fire for a large group of insurgents . Giants among men: A rare gathering of three living recipients of Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, from left, Corporal Mark Donaldson, Keith Payne who won the VC in Vietnam, and (right) Ben Roberts-Smith who also earned his honour while fighting in Afghanistan . Known in the British military as Captain Harry Wales, the fourth in line to the throne will fulfill one of his dreams by embedding with the Australian SAS. The first threat to his life by the Taliban came between December, 2007 and February, 2008 when as a 23-year-old he spent ten weeks on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets. In his book The Crossroad, Corporal Donaldson revealed how the SAS regiment had uncovered a Taliban fighter codenamed Javelin in Afghanistan in 2008. Targeted by the Taliban: A Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin targeted Prince Harry on his first tour of Afghanistan and in 2012 warlords again threatened to 'eliminate' the prince . 'Javelin had been saying he was going to take out Prince Harry,' he wrote. 'We flew by Chinook to a place called Paygolkar to go after two targets codenamed Longbow and Javelin. They were supposed to be important Taliban commanders.' On the first night time attempt by Donaldson and his fellow Australian commandos, they entered the compound where the Javelin was based, in Uruzgan province,a Taliban stronghold in central Afghanistan, but the commander got away. Almost a year later in 'an exact same type of job, at the exact time of night', Donaldson writes in The Crossroad, they shot him dead. 'We went into Paygolkar one night, searching for codename Longbow. We went onto the roof of the same compound we'd been in the previous year and found nine rocket-propelled grenade warheads and a landmine. 'We didn't get Longbow, but three Talibs squirted from the target building just before we were able to take it down. They ran straight into our cordon teams and were killed. ""One had a very nice chrome-plated, clean AK-47. He turned out to be Javelin, the target we'd gone after a year earlier in the same area. Further evidence established that he had a job helping high-value individuals coming in from Pakistan.' Prince Harry's first tour in Afghanistan was cut short after an imposed media blackout on his presence there was breached. He returned for a second tour in 2012, when again the Taliban voiced a threat to 'eliminate him'. Corporal Mark Donaldson was to have further brushes with Afghan fighters, being shot in the leg in 2012. In his memoir, he revealed more details of the incident in which his bravery had earned him the Victoria Cross. On September 2, 2008, just weeks after his first attempt to kill the Taliban warlord Javelin, the SAS trooper and twelve other Australians in a military convoy were ambushed by a large group of insurgents. One of the interpreters had been shot and was lying on the ground. Despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue the wounded man, while under heavy machine gun fire. In 2013 the prince visited SAS HQ in Perth to pay tribute to special forces troops killed in the line of duty, and is said to have met Donaldson. Next week, he will get his first chance to join the elite group and perhaps be trained in house-to-house combat using live rounds by the highly decorated soldier who killed the warlord who threatened the prince's life. Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday to kick-off his final, four week long tour of duty. The royal's last tour before hanging up his fatigues and retiring from the armed services will also see him serve alongside Australian soldiers in Darwin and Sydney. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday ahead of his four-week stint with the Australian Defence Force, which will be his last tour of duty in the military . The prince will spend time with Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers in the Northern Territory, and the Australian Army's Sydney-based 6th Aviation Regiment. If he passes military testing, it is possible he'll fly helicopters while with the Sydney regiment. The prince will join diggers on urban training exercises and bush patrols as well as pack marches and physical training. Before the military stretch gets underway, Prince Harry will travel to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, according to an Australian Defence Force statement. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will fall in with elite soldiers at the Perth SAS base and take on training exercises in the bush with the indigenous unit NORFORCE operating out of Darwin . He will also be allowed to spend time off-base, meaning Harry will have plenty of time for handshakes with his fans, but he is also said to be looking forward to training with the elite Australian SAS . 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' the spokesman said, according to the ABC. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' The fourth-in-line to the throne royal will have his army activities briefly interrupted at the end of the month, when he flies to Gallipoli with Prince Charles for Anzac Day commemorations. The ADF confirmed Harry will be given down time off-base during his stint, meaning some lucky punters could have a pint with the prince. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule . Harry will spend time with the elite SAS and Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers during his military exchange . However, the ADF said it has created a very real experience for Prince Harry. 'Defence's focus for this attachment is to provide Captain Wales with an authentic military experience in the Australian Army that builds on his previous experience with coalition forces and complements his work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' a statement read. 'Defence has selected units that best utilise Captain Wales' skills and allow him to experience a broad range of Army capabilities. The attachment will also allow Captain Wales to share the experience and knowledge he has gained over 10 years of military service in the British Armed Forces, including two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan.'",39,211,"war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","london, british, uk, britain, royal, prince, william, harry, england, princess,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, British royal family, second in line to the throne, the royal couple",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"This topic is about heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, the British royal family, the second in line to the throne, and the royal couple.",Sovereign harry is set out toward this last deployment in the first class sas base camp in perth western australia where the fighter who profasses to have shot the taliban warlord who was determined to killing the imperial beneficiary functions as a preparation leader.

Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the 'most creative' player in the world. 'The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,' said Cantona, 'Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.' Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi's 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo's 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona's assessment. 'Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.' Cantona was third in the Ballon d'Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . 'Catalonia won the World Cup,' said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. 'Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. 'My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war.

But Lucia Juliano, of Harris Interactive, which polled 2,000 people for the magazine, said: 'Only 55 per cent of Londoners and 51 per cent of under-25s mentioned chicken as the main source of food poisoning, indicating education among these two groups needs to be ramped up.' Worryingly, 32 per cent of young people believe washing raw chicken before cooking is a good way to avoid poisoning ‚ the opposite of Food Standards Agency advice.

The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mike Mullen knew that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdhal deserted his post in 2009, claim three of the controversial soldier's comrades. The men say that Mullen, who served President Obama and then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates six years ago, was certain that Bergdahl had fled the army and was guilty of desertion. The claims mean that Mullen was in a position to tell the president his soldier had run away five years before National Security Adviser Susan Rice told the world that Bergdahl served honorably. It also casts a huge shadow over the deal to swap five Taliban commanders for Bergdahl that culminated in a Rose Garden ceremony hosted by Obama to celebrate his release and attended by his parents. 'I asked him (Mullen) if he knew about Bergdahl and that he deserted and he (Mullen) told me that he knew of the circumstances surrounding his walking off,' said former Sgt. Matt Vierkant told Fox, 'and that they were developing leads and following leads, trying to do everything they could to get him back.' This development comes one week after officials scheduled a July hearing for the Army sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years. Bergdahl says he walked away because of PTSD and is not a deserter. Vierkrant claims he and two other collegagues, Evan Buetow and Cody Full, were providing security for Mullen while he was on a trip to Afghanistan in December 2009 - six months after Bergdahl was captured. Vierkrant claims that during an unguarded question and answer session, Mullen said they could ask him anything. 'So Matt asked him, you know Bergdahl deserted, what's going on with that? And Admiral Mullen said, 'Yes, we know all the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl walking away from the OP (outpost,)and we're still working on getting him back, figuring out where he is and kind of figuring out that whole situation.' Scroll Down for Video . Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, allegedly told three comrades of Bergdahl that the soldier was a deserter . Specialist Cody Full confirmed that this is what Mullen said as did Buetow. 'I don't remember him being taken aback by it at all, you know, he knew what was going on, he answered not confidently but he didn't have to think about it, he didn't want to give us some political answer,' Buetow explained to Fox. 'He just gave us an answer.' According to former White House aides this means it is inconceivable that Mullen would not have told President Obama and raises questions as to the prisoner swap for a known deserter. 'If Mullen knew, and now it's alleged that he did know, it would be, it would be unthinkable that he didn't pump this up the chain of command, his chain of command, or, tell the president directly,' said Brad Blakeman, a former Bush White House staffer to Fox News. 'At a minimum, this would have been included in the president's daily brief, and at a maximum, it would've been told directly to the President by Mullen.' Days after his rescue (right), Bergdahl (pictured left in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany . U.S. President Barack Obama stands with Bob Bergdahl (R) and Jami Bergdahl (L) as he delivers a statement about the release of their son, prisoner of war U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, in the Rose Garden at the White House in May, 2014 . Mullen spoke to Fox News and defended his decisions. 'From the moment Sgt. Bergdahl went missing, the U.S. Military was focused on finding him--as it does with any serviceman or woman who goes missing. The exact circumstances were not known then, nor did they drive our decisions. We do not leave our people behind.' Vierkant said that he wants to know what his superior officers knew and when they knew it. 'I want to ask him (Mullen) did they brief the White House? Who knew about it and why would you still do this trade knowing all the information that you knew?' said Vierkant. 'We don't leave anyone behind. The thing is, we never left him (Bergdahl) behind. He left us behind. He chose to walk off and do whatever and get captured, that was his fault. Those were his choices.' Bergdahl is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. Officials say Bergdahl walked away from his post in Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He was then released from Taliban control in a prisoner exchange last May for five Taliban commanders. He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy.",39,162,"war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare.

 In broad usage, the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces.

Over the next month, a total of 230 of the vehicles is due to arrive in the troubled region to help Ukrainian forces prepare against further attacks from Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. The U.S. has already sent Ukrainian forces high-tech night-vision goggles, surveillance drones and secure communications systems as part of their commitment. Scroll down for video . The first of 230 armoured Humvees from the United States is unloaded from a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft . The heavily armoured vehicles form part of $75-million worth of non-lethal military aid to Ukraine from the US . The Humvees, pictured, are unarmed, but heavy machine guns can easily be fitted to the roof turrets . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: 'I have just personally seen - having been behind the wheel of the Humvee - that it is an extremely effective, extremely powerful, extremely good military vehicle which Ukrainian air forces, Ukrainian special divisions, the Ukrainian army are waiting for today.' He told Ukraine Today: 'And I as the president of Ukraine, as commander-in-chief, on behalf of the Ukrainian people, would like to thank to the United States of America for its comprehensive and firm position regarding the resolution of the conflict in the Donbass, for recognising Russia as an aggressor which annexed Crimea and which launched direct military aggression in particular areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.' So far, President Barack Obama has decided against equipping Ukraine with offensive military equipment, although the armoured Humvee vehicles donated to Ukraine have turrets which can be easily fitted with heavy machine guns. Fighting in the region has abated although there are some skirmishes still being reported. Although, President Obama has deployed A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft to Powidz airbase in western Poland. The four tank-killing aircraft are involved in a number of training missions until the weekend. Meanwhile, EU leaders will hold a summit with President Poroshenko in Kiev about the status of the Minsk ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, pictured, thanked the United States for the delivery . President Poroshenko said the Humvees were 'very powerful and extremely good military vehicles' President Poreshenko met with the flight crew, pictured, and representatives of the US Embassy in Kiev . Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebiynis said: 'We expect that the EU-Ukraine summit will take place on April 27.' European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk are expected to attend, as well as EU heads of state and government who wish to go, EU officials added. Trade issues will likely also be on the agenda, the officials said. The summit will be a chance for Poroshenko, who attended an EU summit in Brussels in February, to brief leaders on whether the Ukraine ceasefire deal is fully working and to shape the EU's decision on whether to extend or lift sanctions on Russia. EU leaders agreed last week that economic sanctions imposed on Russia will stay in place until a Ukraine peace deal is fully implemented, effectively extending them to the end of the year if need be. But they will still have to take a formal decision later on whether to extend economic sanctions on Russia expiring in July. Russia has always denied assertions by Ukraine, backed by the United States and the European Union, that it has been sending arms and troops across the border to support the pro-Moscow separatists. EU leaders will meet President Poroshenko, pictured, in a summit in Kiev next month to discuss the crisis . Despite the reduction in violence, innocent civilians are still being killed and injured as a result of the conflict. Three people were killed and six were injured after the bus they were travelling in struck a landmine in eastern Ukraine. The bus had been in the process of crossing from government to rebel-held territory. A local police official, Ilya Kyva, said the bus had been carrying about 20 passengers from Artemivsk, a government-held town north of the region's main city of Donetsk, to Horlivka, which is held by the separatists, about 22 miles away. The bus struck the land mine as it apparently tried to negotiate around a road block manned by government forces, Interfax quoted Kyva as saying. Kyva said the six injured people were 'in a serious condition'.

The spending habits of U.S. Republican Aaron Schock have been widely scrutinized after he used $40,000 in taxpayer funds to redecorate his Washington office in the style of the Downton Abbey television show. Now it has been claimed he spent $10,000 taking 10 staff members on a trip to New York to coincide with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Illinois Republican Aaron Schock (pictured) is embroiled in yet another spending controversy after it emerged he used $10,000 of taxpayers' funds to have 10 staffers accompany him on a trip to New York City . In the latest development, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Schock staffers did almost no government work there and House disbursement records show he received the $10,053 for 'travel subsistence' between September 26 and 29. The events with the Indian prime minister were September 27 and 28. And about 20 tickets to a Global Citizen Festival concert - where performers included Jay Z and Carrie Underwood - were purchased using $3,000 from a Schock campaign fund. Schock, at an event Monday in Chicago, told reporters the New York trip was official business and he was honored his staff could attend. Schock said about a dozen world leaders including President Barack Obama spoke. His spokesman has said that Schock wanted to play a 'constructive role' in Modi's visit to further economic ties between the U.S. and India. 'It was a very legitimate trip on official business,' he told reporters. 'I'm glad that I played such a significant role in it. And I'm honored that my staff was able to be there with me as well.' Schock would not address questions about why he took so many staff members. Other Illinois congressmen made the same trip but without staff members and some paid for the trip out of personal funds. Photos taken in January of Schock's new office in the Rayburn Office Building, which was designed to resemble the dining room of the TV show Downton Abbey . Schock's financial charges have been made public after organizations questioned what his expenses were going toward. He has spent thousands on concerts and car mileage reimbursements . Schock yesterday also defended his frequent Illinois travel as his way of reaching constituents. He noted that his central Illinois district is geographically expansive, including parts of Peoria, Bloomington and Springfield, and says he has fewer district offices than other congress members. 'Some people spend more on direct mail pieces that they send out,' he told reporters. 'I spend more to get around my district.' Last month the Associated Press identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on aircraft belonging to Schock's donors since mid-2011. Beyond air travel, Schock spent thousands more on tickets for concerts, car mileage reimbursements - among the highest in Congress. Other official expenses that have been made by Schock include taking interns to a sold-out Katy Perry show last year and a Bears game. Schock has said that he's hired a firm to review his spending. He's reimbursed the government $40,000 for the office decorations and $1,200 for the Bears game flight. Schock also used official expenses to attend a Chicago Bears game (pictured) last year.

The millionaire gay father of a child brought up by a lesbian couple he donated sperm to must pay £20,000 to cover their costs in an extraordinary triangular legal battle between the boy's three parents. The man - named in High Court papers as JF - helped the women have a child in 2007 but the mothers now say he is being too demanding over access to the seven-year-old. After the boy was born JF - who has dual British and US citizenship and lives in a £1.2million pound home in the South of England - had irregular contact with him and took him to America twice. But his relationship broke down with the mothers, who complained that the father had become 'increasingly individualistic and demanding about contact', the court heard. Today Mr Justice Mostyn - one of Britain's most senior family judges - ruled that in the absence of legal aid JF must pay 80 per cent of the mothers' costs as they continue to fight him in court. The judge blamed the Government's 'grossly unfair' legal aid cuts that mean the father should have to pay £20,596 now, and 80 per cent of future costs run up by the women, known as MG and JG. 'But that it where the Government has left him. It is a sorry state of affairs,' added the judge. The boy's mothers, who live in the North of England and are known only as MG, now 35, and JG, now 45, met in in 2005 and entered a civil partnership in July 2006. They wanted a child and responded to an entry by JF in a register for 'lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner' and accepted his sperm so they could have a child. MG carried the baby and gave birth in April 2007 and the couple agreed that JG became a legal step-parent and it was agreed all three would have legal rights to the boy - JFG - who was registered as an American citizen. Until October 2012 JF enjoyed periodic contact with his son and had even taken him to America with the two mothers on a couple of occasions. Turned sour: The seven-year-old boy is now at the centre of a bitter and expensive legal battle between his parents . In December 2013 JF issued an application in the High Court for more regular contact with his son, sparking an ongoing legal battle with the lesbian couple, who have since split up and run out of money. During eight court hearings legal costs have built up and the mothers have extended their mortgage to pay for it. But with 'modest means' they cannot afford any more. The judge said 'unfortunately' in April 2014 the two mothers separated but continue to work together in court. Under the old system both would have been entitled to legal aid, said the judge. But in April 2013 the Legal Aid, Sentence and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 ( LASPO) came into force. It removed legal aid from private law children proceedings and 'at a stroke, 63 years of state funding of cases such as this was swept away,' said the judge. Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'With the state washing its hands of MG and JG they now look to JF to fund their representation.' He said although the barristers in the case had reduced their fees they could not be expected to work for nothing. He added: 'So even though it cannot be said that JF has behaved reprehensibly or unreasonably he is the only realistic source of costs funding, subject to whatever contribution MG and JG should make from their own very limited resources. Some may say (and have said) that this is grossly unjust; I myself refrain from comment.' He said: 'Even though MG and JG are certainly not entitled to an order for costs they are entitled to seek an order for costs funding. To JF that may seem (with reason) to be a specious distinction without a difference, but that is where we find ourselves, now that the fourth pillar of the welfare state has been largely demolished.' Now the father must pay more than £20,000 to the women the High Court battle will continue, with a ruling over access now likely later this year. An Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless. At the time legal aid reform began not only had this Government inherited an unprecedented financial crisis but our legal aid bill was one of the most expensive in the world at around £2billion a year. 'We want to make sure family cases happen in the least divisive way possible, which is why we encourage people to use mediation and other out of court options that we know are less stressful and confrontational than going to court - and as a result are often more successful. 'It's for this reason we've significantly increased mediation funding and also recently announced new measures to give better support to those who decide to go to court and represent themselves. 'In some cases, though, court clearly is the only answer which is why, even after reform, we will still have one of the most generous legal aid system at around £1.5 billion a year.'",46,128,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","the matrimonial laws in India, including laws on marriage, divorce and ...

But this is the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and the intimate shot marks not 40 years of marriage but 10. The couple, who married a decade ago at the Windsor Guildhall, are spending their anniversary privately at Birkhall in Deeside. Scroll down for video . Portrait of a happy marriage: Charles and Camilla in the new photo released to mark their 10th anniversary . Big day: The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on their wedding day a decade ago . Birkhall, which sits on the Queen's Balmoral estate, was the location for their honeymoon and was also the venue for their first anniversary celebrations. The new image, which is the work of top photographer Oliver Dann, was taken in the run-up to last month's visit to the U.S but was released by Clarence House today. In it, Charles wears a country coat made from Inveravon Estate Tweed and a matching hat by Lock & Co, while Camilla sports a hat by the same firm and a coat by Moncler. Charles and Camilla finally married following a relationship spanning 35 years in a relatively quiet civil ceremony at the Windsor Guildhall on the 9th April 2005. Despite fears that the couple would be booed - Camilla was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed - the ceremony went off without a hitch. Since then, the Duchess of Cornwall as she is now known, has become an integral part of the Royal Family - and would be cheerfully accepted as Charles' queen by 50 per cent of Britons. That marks a significant turnaround from the Duchess' earliest days as a royal, with Camilla following Charles' lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers. But her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the Queen is now said to be close. 'Her role has changed dramatically,' explains royal biographer Penny Junor. 'One minute she was a mistress and then she was an HRH. 'When she first married Charles she was very nervous. On her wedding day, she was terrified. She had no idea if she would be booed in the street. 'In fact, there was a very warm reception. The streets were packed in Windsor. She has slowly gained courage and confidence. Initially she was very much in the background, supporting the Prince and she still does that. 'She's never had any ambition for herself. She didn't want to be a princess or a duchess. She just happened to love a man who was the Prince of Wales and look at the fuss that caused. She doesn't want to be a star or be curtseyed to. Happy: The pair are all smiles as they arrive at the British ambassador's residence in Washington last month . Cheers! Charles and Camilla pictured enjoying a dram during a visit to Birkhall last summer . 'But slowly, slowly she has become much more involved in royal life and taken on an awful lot of charitable causes.' The Duchess is now patron or president of 85 charities, joint patron or president with the Prince of four, and is affiliated to a number of other organisations. Ms Junor added: 'It's really, really valued by those charities. She works extremely hard. Having been a woman who up to her mid-50s had been a wife and a mother and a country woman who enjoyed horses and dogs, she's completely reinvented herself and become an ambassador for the country.' In 2013, Camilla made her first ever appearance at the State Opening of Parliament wearing a glamorous champagne silk and lace Bruce Oldfield gown. The Duchess, whose presence was seen as a boost for Charles, topped that with the Queen Mother's priceless Boucheron tiara and the Dame Grand Cross of the Victoria Order sash. She returned for the 2014 state opening as well and is expected to return once again for this year's event.

During the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, the Queen and Camilla sat side-by-side in the ornate 1902 state landau - a step that would have been inconceivable a decade earlier. The Duke of Edinburgh had fallen ill and the Prince of Wales and Camilla stepped in to ride with the monarch in the carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace. But it was Camilla, not Charles who was seated next to the Jubilee Queen. She was present too on stage, standing next to the sovereign, as Charles paid tribute to his mother at the finale of a pop concert in front of the Palace. During the Golden Jubilee concert in 2002, prior to her marriage to the Prince, Camilla was seated several rows behind Charles. On Charles and Camilla's seventh wedding anniversary in 2012, the Queen made the Duchess a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) - a personal seal of approval from the monarch. 'I don't think that the Queen has ever had any personal animosity to Camilla. In the Eighties and Nineties when Charles and Diana were at each other's throats, Camilla was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy,' says Ms Junor. 'The Queen has always been fond of Camilla. She knew her for years and years, long before she was involved in the break up of the marriage.' She added: 'The Queen reacts to public opinion. Once the public were going to accept Camilla, the Queen was able to accept her publicly. 'They've got a great deal in common. They're mad about horses, dogs. They're country women.' When Camilla married Charles, aides insisted she did not want to be known as queen when the Prince acceded to the throne but intended to be known as princess consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become queen when Charles is king - no matter what she decides to call herself. At the time of her engagement to the Prince in 2005, a poll showed that only seven per cent of people believed Camilla should one day be queen. Happily married: Charles has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage . Close: The Duchess has always known how to make Charles laugh and he 'adores her' in return . Royal duties: With half of Britons supporting the idea, it is increasingly likely that Camilla will become queen . A decade later, half of all Britons say she should become queen when Charles takes the throne according to a poll by YouGov. A third think she should be given a lesser title out of sensitivity to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were unsure. When the Prince was put on the spot and asked if Camilla would be his queen in an interview in November 2010, he replied: 'That's, that's, we'll see, won't we? That could be.' 'I think there's still a hard core of people out there who want nothing to do with Camilla and think she's the devil incarnate but the vast majority think she's a good thing,' adds Ms Junor. 'She is familiar now as any member of the Royal Family. She's a fixture. It would be very strange if she were not called queen. 'I think she will be embraced and think the public will have no problem with it whatsoever. Charles is hugely proud of her and she's so important to him. 'He adores her. He wants her by his side - that's an absolute given.' Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an ""Enid Blyton sort of Childhood"",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help ‚ help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fte. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.",211,115,"london, british, uk, britain, royal, prince, william, harry, england, princess,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, British royal family, second in line to the throne, the royal couple","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about heir to the throne, Prince William and Prince Harry, the British royal family, the second in line to the throne, and the royal couple.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.","As the world mourns the death of Prince Philip, here's a look at the British royal family and what his passing means for the line of succession.It all starts with Queen Elizabeth II, eldest daughter of George VI and Queen Elizabeth and the world's currently longest-reigning monarch.In 1947, the Queen, born in 1926, married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who is the son of Princess Alice of Battenberg and Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark.Prince Charles, the heir apparent to the British throne, married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 earning her the title Diana, Princess of Wales.Together they welcomed sons Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, in 1982; and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, in 1984.Prince Charles and Princess Diana had a contentious relationship, complicated by affairs on both sides.

Victory this season with Bayern, who face Porto in the quarter-finals starting Wednesday night at the Dragao, would make Alonso only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso admitted to The Telegraph. Xabi Alonso lines up for Bayern Munich on Wednesday night against Porto at the Dragao Stadium . The Champions League first leg quarter-final is the next step in his quest to win the title with three clubs . 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' Alonso said. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to be a pundit rather than a player for the final win over Atletico Madrid. Alonso trains under the watchful eye of manager Pep Guardiola who is keen to add to his Barcelona victories . Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Real Madrid and twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007. At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. But first his side must overcome Porto, who are the only unbeaten side in the competition this year. And they will have to do it for the first leg at least with a host of stars including Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger, along with David Alaba, Medhi Benatia, Javi Martnez and Tom Starke.

The Pope has been told by doctors that he must lose weight, it has been reported. Vatican medics told Francis to cut his pasta intake to two servings a week and take a daily walk, like his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI did. They are concerned about the sedentary lifestyle of the 78-year-old Catholic leader ‚ who spends much of his time hard at work at his desk or in meetings ‚ as well as his considerable weight gain since he took office two years ago, sources told Italian news agency ANSA. The Pope's weight is thought to be aggravating his sciatica, a nerve condition which causes back pain. Francis himself has suggested that he does not expect to live to an old age. Two weeks ago he told Mexican TV he did not think his papacy would last long. And on a plane back from South Korea last summer he said that his reign would only last 'a short time, two or three years and then‚¶ to the house of the Father.' Now doctors have told the Catholic leader that he must shed a few pounds as the extra weight is making his sciatica worse, especially when combined with his intense travel schedule. But the pope who reacted by joking refers to himself as 'the undisciplined one' is taking little heed of their warning, continuing to tuck into a bowl of pasta every day.

Such visits are in accordance with the commandment of the Divine Founder of the Church, our Lord Jesus Christ.The Ecumenical Patriarchate, with its open and ecumenical spirit, developed a series of ecumenical initiatives of historical importance in the well-known Encyclicals of 1902, 1904 and 1920. These encyclicals aimed at the unity of all Christians in the communion of faith and sacraments. These initiatives of the Ecumenical Patriarchate have led to a Theological Dialogue of the Orthodox Church with the sister Roman-Catholic Church ""on equal terms.""It has been the goal that beyond all other fraternal gestures, the mutual visits of Popes to Constantinople and Ecumenical Patriarchs to Rome have marked a new era in the relations between the two Churches. It has helped in the understanding of the people of God, that there be effort, from both sides, for the achievement of the unity, so ""that all may be one"", according to the words of the Lord in His High Priestly Prayer (John: 17)","It is a question many dieters are asking when they are tweaking their diet for optimal weight loss!The truth is, as long as you don't have any diabetes or other health issues, you are much better off changing your diet according to your blood sugar levels.It means instead of jumping on yet another weight loss diet; you should measure your blood sugar levels and tailor your diet accordingly. We will talk more about how to do that later in this article.According to research from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Colorado, studies suggest that your glucose and insulin levels in your blood are biomarkers for how you convert carbohydrates. At the same time, they are also markers for whether you feel full or not after having a meal.The faster you feel full and satisfied, the fewer calories you will consume. Eating according to your blood sugar levels can help you accomplish that.If you don't feel full and satisfied when having a meal and can keep eating, your diet is wrong. From here, it is merely a question about changing the food components in your diet."

The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video . Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria . Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS . Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left . Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive.

The race comes less than three weeks after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the then-19-year-old Chechen Cambridge resident who brought bombs to the race, was found guilty of all the terrorism charges against him in a trial that saw moving testimony from victims who had lost loved ones and limbs. Tsarnaev, now 21, could face the death penalty after sentencing in federal court. Some victims of the attack have spoken out saying they are against capital punishment for the young man. Newlyweds Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the bombing, said that they support life without parole so that Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible,' according to the Boston Globe. 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance,' they said.

The wife of a Florida postal worker who landed a gyrocopter on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol to protest campaign finance laws says her husband is a patriot. After more than two years of planning, 61-year-old Doug Hughes made it through restricted airspace and a no-fly zone in a gyrocopter Wednesday carrying 535 letters -- one for each member of Congress -- and landed the aircraft on the Capitol lawn. Although Hughes was promptly arrested for the stunt and charged Thursday with violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft, Hughes' wife Alena says she is proud of her husband. 'From the public point of view this is very brave,' Alena told WFLA. 'I think he's patriot and I'm proud of him.' Hughes has since been released on his own recognizance and is allowed to return to Florida under certain conditions. The mailman has received support on both Facebook and Twitter for the stunt. The 61-year-old even has a fan page on Facebook called 'Doug Hughes is awesome' and many Twitter users have riddled the social media site with kudos for the man. Scroll down for video .

The daughter of a millionaire lottery winning couple who stole over £22,000 from a children's nursery has escaped jail - after the cash was paid back. Samantha Crossland, 30, was pocketing parents' fees being paid to the Child's Play day nursery she worked at in a trusted position. She had been told she faced a custodial sentence unless the money was paid back and Crossland - whose parents made over a million on the lotto - handed back the cash. Nursery owner Lynda Quigley confirmed that the amount stolen - £22,642 - had been paid into her bank account on from an ""S. Crossland"". It was not clear whether this was Samantha - or her mother Susan Crossland. Crossland had even been promoted to manager at the nursery by its owner who knew her and trusted her. Much of the money was taken from a cash box on the wall that parents left their fees in. Leeds Crown Court court heard that only Crossland and Mrs Quigley had keys to this. It was only when Mrs Quigley returned to the nursery in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in early 2014, that she became aware of discrepancies in the accounts. In total these came to £22,642. Crossland was arrested and gave four no comment interviews. She later pleaded guilty to one count of theft. The court heard today that Mrs Quigley had received £22,643 via bank transfer on April 22. Crossland, of Mirfield, West Yorkshire was sentenced to a 12-month community order and 180 hours unpaid work. Recorder Ray Singh said: 'You were in a position of significant trust by Miss Quigley. You were left alone to deal with the money, it is therefore a breach of trust. 'Staff parents and the like were no doubt finding it very difficult to understand what was happening."" Mrs Quigley, who has had the nursery for 14-years, said after the hearing: 'I feel really relieved that I'm finally going to get closure now that the court case has finished and the money taken has been repaid in full. 'I'm happy that justice has been served after what has been a very difficult year. 'But I still have no idea why she did this to me - why a good friend would betray me like this.' Crossland's parents Michael and Susan won more than £1.2 million on the lottery back in July 2008 . The money was stolen by Crossland, pictured, from the Child's Play nursery in west Yorkshire . Crossland refused to comment on her sentence while leaving court. Crossland's parents, Susan and Michael, hit the headlines after winning £1.2 million on the lottery in 2008. At the time of their win, mum-of-four Susan said she believed her £1,218,618 windfall was down to her late father Barrie - as she played his numbers each week in the two years since he had died. Speaking in July 2008, she said: She said: 'My win must be fate which is why I saw the feathers and won on his number line. 'During the week before the draw, I was seeing white feathers everywhere and I never know where they come from. 'Just two-days before the win, we were tickling my dog Ruby at home and a white feather just floated down from nowhere and landed on her tummy. I knew it was dad trying to say something.

But while historical precedent suggests the President might indeed have the authority to move forward without Congress, the Obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history: Getting Congress' signature might be worth the effort. True, the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy. But it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive-based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of Congress. The President and his advisers have avoided using the term ""treaty,"" instead explaining that it would be a ""nonbinding agreement."" According to Secretary of State John Kerry: ""We've been very clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement."" On ""Meet the Press,"" Kerry said, ""What we're looking for is not to have Congress interfere with our ability, inappropriately, by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the President."" There is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues, with the potential for court challenges. But outside of the legal debate, there are also significant political questions, and those are a different beast altogether. For a start, there is growing pressure on Capitol Hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give Congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, a deal was reached on legislation proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker that would require President Barack Obama to submit the final deal to Congress, giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement. Corker told MSNBC on Tuesday that negotiators had reached a ""bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact, full of integrity."" What's in the Iran bill and why all the fuss? There is good reason for Obama to avoid calling this a treaty. After all, given the contentious political environment on Capitol Hill, where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget, the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best. But there is also a history of Congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties. In the late 1970s, for example, President Jimmy Carter tried to obtain consent for the SALT II treaties, but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that Carter was weak on defense. Carter pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail. After Iranians took American hostages and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the treaties died in the Senate. Yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment, presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political capital, and even once the White House exited the struggle bruised and battered, the historic treaties endured. Top GOP, Dem senators say Iran compromise reached . This was the case with another treaty that Carter asked the Senate to ratify: the Panama Canal Treaties of 1978. Carter decided that turning authority of the canal over to Panama was essential to regional peace and stability. He knew this would be tough sell, and Tennessee Republican Howard Baker for his part predicted he wouldn't even get 20 votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the Committee to Save the Panama Canal and the Emergency Coalition to Save the Panama Canal. Indeed, they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the Soviets a foothold in the region. However, Carter countered aggressively, both on a personal level -- helping secure the vote of Sen. Richard Stone of Florida by sending a personal letter to the senator, dispatching experts to Florida to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state-of-the-art telephone hookups. In the end, the Senate ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two-thirds majority, although Carter also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight. President Ronald Reagan faced a similar challenge. Toward the end of his presidency, he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the Soviet Union. Yet despite excitement in the White House and across the nation about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Washington in December 1987, many conservatives blasted the decision, arguing that Reagan had betrayed the conservative cause. During a meeting at the White House, eight Republican senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with Reagan. Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, one of Reagan's closest allies, said: ""The Soviets have broken most every treaty they have ever signed. ... How do we assure compliance with the new treaty?"" Right-wing organizations, meanwhile, compared Reagan with Neville Chamberlain. Reagan responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion. In a hearing on the treaty, Secretary of State George Shultz attacked North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, who had accused Reagan of ""confusion, misstatements and ... even misrepresentation."" He met with Republicans, spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal. Despite their protests, most Republicans eventually came around. On May 27, 1988, the Senate ratified the treaty 93-5. Helms, one of the few to vote against the treaty, admitted they were ""licked."" And the treaty, which marked the beginning of the end for the Cold War, has endured. The reality is that the signature of Congress is still worth a lot in American politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president. Congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas. All this will be true with Iran, especially as many members of Obama's own party are leery about the agreement. Ultimately, the President probably has the right to go his own way with this, and his frustration with Congress might create strong incentives for doing so. But in the long term, persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. The good news is that there have been some statements from the White House that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of Congress in a solid deal.

And now a new poll on modern families reveals this is a reality for almost a quarter of Britons ‚ who said their pet dog was more important to them than their in-laws. Of the 2,071 people surveyed, 22 per cent cited their pets as a close family member, above in-laws (21 per cent) but below grandparents at 26 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new poll on modern families reveals almost a quarter of Brits prefer their pets to their in-laws . The research commissioned by Matalan for its Made for Modern Families campaign also found that the 'Brady Bunch' or 'blended' household where children had multi-parental figures was also on the rise. More than one in 10 British families now live in 'blended' families as more people with children divorce, remarry other parents and their households merge. As a result a fifth of all children ‚ more than the entire population of Birmingham and London combined - have participated in their own parents' wedding, the poll found. Spending quality time together as a family is still important with 65 per cent saying eating together at a table was one of their favourite family activities and 30 per cent claiming to enjoy playing board games and doing arts and crafts together. Over a third (35 per cent) said that their family's happiness was their top priority, compared to just 6 per cent who cited money as most important. Mark Earls, a leading behavioural expert and fellow of the Marketing Society, said: 'Contrary to those who have bemoaned the decline of the family as a key pillar of our society, family is alive and well ‚ it just comes in many more different shapes and sizes than it used to including the ""blended' or ""Brady Bunch"" family, which consists of one or more adults with their own children and those from previous relationships. The interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people's least favourite family member, as in 2004 film Monster-in-Law starring Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez . 'More than one in ten British families have this kind of arrangement. Such a scenario can create a situation in which the age gap between the youngest and eldest child/step-child can be more than a decade, as our survey found. 'Ultimately, what we want for our families is what we've always wanted for those we love - health and happiness. However much the shape and the structures and the participants shift, it seems these same old truths abide. The family is here to stay.' While the Beckhams were seen by 20 per cent of people questioned as the best representation of the modern family, 16 per cent thought it was Jamie Oliver's brood, followed by the Jolie-Pitts at 7 per cent. Next in line from the list were Will Smith's family (4 per cent) and Elton John and David Furnish (3 per cent). The research saw data compiled by YouGov reviewed by Mr Earls for Matalan as part of its commitment to understanding today's modern families. Jason Hargreaves, Managing Director of Matalan, said: 'Family life has changed dramatically since we first opened our doors 30 years ago.

Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, announced Monday that she will not run for re-election. 'Do I spend my time raising money, or do I spend my time raising hell?' the 78-year-old old Maryland Democrat, now in her fifth term, said she asked herself when deliberating whether to seek a sixth term next year. 'I don't want to spend my time campaigning for me. I want to campaign for the people,' she said at a news conference in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore. 'Do I spend my time promising what I would do ‚ or do it now and do it the way I like to?' Senate Appropriations Committee Ranking Democrat Barbara Mikulski, a Marylander shown in 2012, announced that her plans for the future don't include Congress . The diminutive Mikulski, seen standing on a box behind a Senate podium, castigated Republicans on Feb. 24 for refusing to pass a Homeland Security funding bill without a string attached that would de-fund the persident's executive actions on immigration . Mikulski, a tough, no-nonsense lawmaker who rose to the leadership of the powerful Appropriations Committee, became the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress in 2012. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and has served in the Senate since 1987. She said that when her term has ended, 'I will know that I will have given it my best shot.' Her retirement is certain to set off a race among potential candidates to succeed her, including Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, and former Govs. Martin O'Malley, who is considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Republican Bob Ehrlich. She becomes the second Senate Democratic woman to announce her retirement this year, following Barbara Boxer of California. In a 2014 interview, Mikulski said her approach as chair of the Appropriations panel was 'to focus with civility and courtesy. Old school values. Don't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press.' In her state, she has been fiercely protective of the environment, especially Chesapeake Bay issues. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described Mikulski at the time as forceful and results-oriented. 'I think she's terrific,' he said. Mikulski had been seen as more engaging and approachable than her predecessors as appropriations chairman, the late Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Daniel Inouye, Hawaii, both Democrats. She had spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties, learning their needs and end goals. After a short tenure as chairman, she now is the top Democrat on the panel after Republicans captured control of the Senate in last November's elections. 'She knows that if you know somebody and what they want, you can help them be successful. And when you help people be successful, Republicans or Democrats, that's how you move bills,' said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Mikulski protege. Mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women. The Maryland senator sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill in an April 2014 floor showdown. 'When I hear all these phony reasons, some are mean and some are meaningless, I do get emotional,' Mikulski said of arguments against the legislation. 'I get angry. I get outraged. I get volcanic.' Mikulski played off former CIA Director Michael Hayden's recent comment that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, was motivated by 'emotional feeling' when she sought an investigation of the spy agency's harsh treatment of terrorism suspects .",175,113,"house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","Barbara Mikulski, is the longest running woman in Congress history.

Nye held court with press making the trip before boarding the airliner, telling them, I love the smell of jet fuel, according to an account provided to White House reporters. The White House said Tuesday that Nye, who has degrees in engineering but was made famous by his 90s era television show for school children, 'Bill Nye the Science Guy,' would make the trek today on its behalf to shoot a video of the president. On the road trip from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the Florida swamp and back again, a 1,836 mile flight, Nye will have ample opportunity to take a big whiff of the carbon being emitted from the president's jet as it burns up more than 9,180 gallons of fuel.

Global warming triumverate Barack Obama (center) Bill Nye (left) and Neil DeGrasse Tyson (right) shared a selfie moment in the Blue Room of the White House last year . Off to save the planet: Obama flew nearly 2,000 miles round-trip on Earth Day to the Florida Everglades and back . Nye told press it was his first time on the president's private jet, but he once rode AF2 with former Vice President Al Gore. And, while he was working as an engineer at Boeing in 1978, Nye said he designed an anti-vibration tube for the horizontal stabilizer that is used in the company's 747 planes, and likely AF1. In a tweet last night, Nye said he was 'heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One with President Obama. 'We're going to '#ActonClimate,' he wrote. 'That said, the excitement, much like #climatechange, is real,' he added in a follow-up tweet a minute later. The statements were met with puzzled responses. 'Doesn't jet travel leave a big carbon footprint?' user Timothy Grome wrote. 'Hmm, seems ironic. doesn't seem very climate friendly earth day,' Allison B. of Galveston, Texas, said. White House communications director Jen Psaki got some 'cool points' today by posing for a selfie with Nye . Obama used the Earth Day trip to promote his administration's commitment to cutting carbon pollution and preserving Florida's wetlands, taking a tour of Everglades National Park and giving a speech that was first cancelled this morning for the public because of heavy showers, then rescheduled. 'I can't think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation's greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he's looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly. The White House's official photographer, Pete Souza, posted this image to Instagram today with the following caption: 'It's @billnye (The Science Guy) on Marine One talking science on Earth Day with the President, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz' 'I can say as a general matter that the Department of Defense has acknowledged that climate change does pose a national security threat to the United States,' Earnest added. 'And there are a lot of practices that the Department of Defense has taken to try to reduce their carbon footprint.' Knoller, the unofficial historian of the modern White House, also frequently calculates how much fuel AF1 guzzles up ‚ including during today's trip. Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott lit into Obama and Congress in anticipation of the president's visit. He accused them of not providing his state with what he believes to be appropriate financial resources to protect the Everglades . 'Our environment is too important to neglect and it's time for the federal government to focus on real solutions and live up to their promises,' he said in a statement. Earnest mocked the GOP executive in comments to CBS DC and noted that Scott had 'outlawed employees in the State of Florida from even uttering the word ""climate change.""

And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday. The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the 'no expense spared' jaunt. Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows . Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break . The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham ‚ who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent ‚ plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: 'I don't feel bad about using taxpayers' money. We're entitled to a holiday.' The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham's monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver ‚ bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break . Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government's £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham's five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: 'We're good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.' Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is 'too cramped'. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand's handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag ‚ thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with. Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife's five youngest children .

London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year's record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital.

Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future ‚ and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo . But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair 'slab' structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: 'House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year ‚ but it will still be positive. 'The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. 'It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. 'House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.' It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates ‚ deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: 'Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound ‚ making London more expensive for European buyers ‚ has affected prices in the capital.

The unidentified teenager is a victim and was released on Monday from juvenile detention into the custody of county child protective services, said Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson. 'This child is a victim in this case and can best receive appropriate and necessary services through the dependency court system and family services,' Wolfson said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Jondrew Megil Lachaux (left), 39, an ex-convict and Kellie Cherie Phillips (right), 38, have been arrested on felony charges in the alleged abandonment case of three children in a North Las Vegas home . North Las Vegas police Officer Aaron Patty said the four-month-old child was released from a hospital and turned over on Monday to the custody of Clark County Child Protective Services. Police in North Las Vegas are continuing to probe what they have described as a three-generation case of child abuse involving the girl's mother, Kellie Cherie Phillips, 38, a man she described as her stepfather, Jondrew Magil Lachaux, 39, and the discovery of the couple's three-year-old daughter dead in the back seat of a broken-down car in the garage of a home on Wood Thrush Place. Phillips and Lachaux have six children together while the teenager is from another relationship. Lachaux, an ex-convict, was arrested April 7 and Phillips was arrested April 8 on allegations that they abandoned the teenager and the toddler in a North Las Vegas house and took their other five children to Oakland, California. The other children ‚î ages one, four, seven, eight and nine ‚î were found with Phillips in good health. They have been placed in the custody of family services. Lachaux allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager and she had become pregnant, but she did not know, reports the Review Journal. Phillips and Lachaux, who are not married, were being held pending court appearances this week on felony charges of child abuse. The teen told police that her mother didn't know she was pregnant with Lachaux's child when the rest of the family left last year in a crowded rental car. She said she gave birth at home last November with no medical care. The girl told police her sickly three-year-old sister died several weeks ago, and that Lachaux returned to the house in late March and moved the decomposing corpse to an old Mercedes sedan parked in the garage, covering the corpse with old pizza boxes. A police SWAT team broke into the couple's house (above) and discovered the corpse of the three-year-old girl . Lachaux kicked the teen out of the house, police said, and she lived for several days in public places including the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran International Airport before someone noticed the sick baby and summoned authorities. The infant is recovering after being hospitalized in critical condition for severe malnutrition and hypothermia, police said. The girl told investigators the child survived on watered-down baby formula. Records show that Lachaux served prison time in Nevada from June 2006 to August 2008 on a coercion conviction and that he and Phillips were involved in a legal dispute in Reno's family court until 2010.",200,105,"children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","charged, allegedly, charges, arrested, alleged, investigation, arrest, accused, authorities, office,","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","person arrested and charged, authorities allege, investigation, accused of a crime, under arrest on one charge, under investigation","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.","This topic is about a person arrested and charged, authorities allegations, an investigation, being accused of a crime, being under arrest on one charge, and being under investigation.","A 17-year-old girl was arrested because her 4-month-old daughter was hospitalized and was severely malnourished.

Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting . Innocent: Palestinians, who fled the Yarmouk refugee camp, sit on mattresses inside a school in Damascus . After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said. Destroyed: In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began . A man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp . Anwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday. Before the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital. Yarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011. In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began. The camp has been encircled for more than a year, but is now reported to be almost completely under the control of ISIS and Al Qaeda's local affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. Residents who fled the advancing jihadists last week have been put up in regime-held areas nearby. According to Britain-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nearly 200 people had died in Yarmouk from malnutrition and lack of medicines before last Wednesday's assault.

Wearing a baseball cap sideways, rapper-style, the youth has a swollen eye and chin. 'Daesh came to my home looking for my brother who's in the Palestinian Popular Committees. They beat me until I passed out and left me for dead,' he added, referring to the group by an Arabic acronym . At the entrance to the school, Umm Usama chatted with fellow refugees who had got out. 'I left the camp despite myself,' said the 40-year-old woman who had lived in Yarmouk for 17 years. 'I'd stayed on despite the bombings and famine. It was terrible, we ate grass, but at least I was at home. 'Daesh's arrival meant destruction and massacre. Their behaviour's not human and their religion is not ours,' added the thin woman with sunken eyes.

There are no suitcases to be seen in the classrooms -- the families had to leave so quickly there was no time to pack anything. 'I left without bringing any belongings.

Christine Lillico, 47, from Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was trusted with looking after her elderly parents' bank accounts as their health deteriorated with age. But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost £80,000 from them over a six year period . By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of £78,000. Newcastle Crown Court heard in the last months of his life Mr Air went without a telephone and basic amenities, while suffering the shame of being in debt for the first time in his life because of his daughter's crimes. A judge has now sent Lillico to jail and ordered she pay her brother John Air junior £39,000 - which would have been his inheritance has she not stolen it. Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly years. 'They had modest savings which had taken all their lives to accumulate through hard work. 'Over a period of six years you plundered those savings. 'The result of that was when your father died in 2014 he was in debt, something he had never been in before and that is something that caused him great distress.' The court heard Lillico spent some of the £78,000 on shopping sprees in B&Q (file image) Christopher Knox, prosecuting, explained how Mr and Mrs Air, from Ashington, had both worked in the coal industry and had pensions. The couple gave their daughter control of their bank accounts after they sold their home for £95,000 and moved in to a sheltered flat, as their health began to fail as they grew older. 'The couple lived very sensibly,' said Mr Knox. 'By 2008 there was at least £55,000 in a savings account.' The court heard Mrs Air, who had suffered from dementia, passed away in October 2010 and Mr Air died in July 2014. But the court heard Lillico had been raiding her parents' accounts since 2008. Debit card transactions were made at various shops including JD Sports and B&Q. The accounts had also been used to pay for photography services and to buy an XBox and cash was also withdrawn from the banks and cheques written. The court heard Lillico is of previous good character. She pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud. It was calculated the amount of money Lillico stole amounted to what she and her brother would have inherited between them. The judge made an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act that she repay the half she owes within six months. Nigel Hedley, defending, said Lillico was hit by financial problems after a difficult divorce. 'She was a woman of good character. She had a very traumatic divorce and encountered severe financial difficulties.' He also said Lillico had been suspended from her job as a medical secretary as a result of her crimes, but that she would be able to pay her brother the money she owed by re-mortgaging her house.",128,195,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","Christine Lillico, 47 pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud.

The 78-year-old leader of the world's Roman Catholics confirmed late last year that he would visit the United States to take part in a Catholic Church congress in Philadelphia. During the trip, he will also address the United Nations in New York and become the first pontiff to address the US Congress. Obama and Francis met for the first time at the Vatican in March last year in talks clouded by disagreements over provisions for contraception included in the US leader's landmark health care reforms. Dialogue: Pope Francis will continue a dialogue about poverty, the environment, immigration and promoting religious freedom . Obama has regularly spoken of his admiration for Francis, repeatedly praising the pontiff for his compassion and modesty. 'As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than two thousand years - that in each other we see the face of God,' Obama said last year. Francis is also widely credited with helping to kickstart the secret diplomacy between Cuba and the United States which culminated with the two Cold War rivals declaring a historic rapprochement last year. According to a Vatican statement, Francis wrote letters to US and Cuban leaders and 'invited them to resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners, in order to initiate a new phase in relations between the two parties.' Obama has regularly spoken of his admiration for Francis, repeatedly praising the pontiff for his compassion and modesty.

Scroll down for video . Australian movie and music downloaders could soon be slapped with a 10 per cent tax in a move that could reel in billions of additional GST revenue for the federal government .

Netflix has indicated that it would increase the cost of its service in line with any new laws and regulations. 'We pay taxes as required under local and national law,' a spokesperson from Netflix US head office said.

It comes after News Corp Australia chief executive Julian Clarke slammed the foreign companies' ability to avoid paying tax, consequently leading to an unlevelled playing field in the advertising market.

""Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn. And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable. As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth. And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too."" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty. And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. ""Everyday Americans need a champion,"" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, ""and I want to be that champion."" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day . With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy. And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap . Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work? Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical. They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's ""image"" as her or his ""substance."" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",113,128,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","Hillary Clinton, the Presidential candidate, has launched a video to start her campaign.

She has announced that if elected President, she would accept a pay cut of 23% herself. This declaration can influence the Presidential campaign to a great extent.","Hillary Clinton has tried to portray an image of a future President who identifies with the working women of America. She says that she would try to address their problems of unequal pay and gender-based wage discrimination.

However, it will influence the middle class working women greatly."

Shakyla Wilson, 22, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to DuPage County prosecutors. The abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence after Wilson accompanied some of the girls from the Hill Middle School basketball team to a movie and spent the night at the sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse after being accused of having inappropriate sexual contact with a Hill Middle School basketball team sleepover. She was a volunteer coach with the team . Wilson, also known as Kiki, began volunteering with the team in an unpaid, unofficial capacity at the end of January, Indian Prairie School District Superintendent Karen Sullivan said in a statement on the district's website. The district immediately notified police when officials became aware of allegations and told Wilson she could not be on school property, Sullivan said. She added: 'We want to stress that the district takes these charges very seriously. As this is now a matter for law enforcement officials to handle, we encourage anyone who may have pertinent information regarding this investigation to contact the Naperville Police Department. 'We are providing support in the school for any student who may need to discuss this issue. If your student wishes to talk with someone at school, please direct him or her to speak with their social worker or guidance counselor.' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall told the Chicago Tribune that he was 'deeply disturbed' by the recent events. 'Ms Wilson purposely put herself in a position of influence and trust in order to prey on the innocence of young girls,' he said. State's Attorney Robert Berlin said that the allegations against Wilson are appalling. 'A coach's role is to motivate and inspire athletes to be the best they can be, both on the court and off it,' he told the Tribune. 'Coaches are there to help athletes attain their goals, not to take advantage of the trust their position holds just to satisfy their own sickening desires.' Wilson was an unpaid, unofficial volunteer girls basketball coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois. She played basketball with the same team when she was in middle school . Though the district does not fingerprint volunteers at elementary or middle school levels, it does background checks through the Raptor system, which is used by 12,000 schools across the United States, according to the Tribune. The program screens a person's driver's license information to find registered sex offenders, Janet Buglio, director of communication services in the district said. 'Everyone entering our schools, including parents and volunteers, surrender their driver's license every time they enter a school to be used for a screening using the Raptor system,' she said. Wilson played basketball on two high schools state championship teams before joining the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team for a year. She then transferred to St Joseph's College where she played basketball for two years.

However the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A 12th defendant, a teacher, was acquitted of all charges by the jury this week. The 11 will all be sentenced on April 8 and could face up to 20 years in prison for the racketeering charges. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses.

One principal was accused of wearing gloves as they erased test score answers and filled in new ones . 'This is a huge story and absolutely the biggest development in American education law since forever,' said University of Georgia law professor Ron Carlson. 'It has to send a message to educators here and broadly across the nation. Playing with student test scores is very, very dangerous business.' The case stems from an investigation carried out in 2011, which uncovered evidence that the educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, serve between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service, repay between $500 and $5,000 in bonus money and complete up to two years of probation. Others testified at the trial against their co-conspirators. However, Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer.

Emotional: Donald Bullock, left, former Atlanta Public Schools Usher-Collier Heights Elementary testing coordinator, reacts as a jury finds him guilty. He is now facing 20 years in prison . Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But, the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement ‚î which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. Hall, who served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief, was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and was credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates. The investigation found that Hall 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' during her time as Superintendent. It also found that she had permitted 'cheating ‚î at all levels ‚î to go unchecked for years'. Investigators believe she may have accepted up to $500,000 in bonus payouts as a result of the ongoing cheating scandal. In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in .

Hall (right) had 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' that had permitted 'cheating ‚î at all levels ‚î to go unchecked for years' The cheating allowed educators to collect bonuses and improve the ailing reputation of the Atlanta school system, the investigation found . It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 . In March 2013, Dr Hall and 34 educators were indicted by a grand jury on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft . 21 of the educators plead guilty to reach plea agreements . They received between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service and must repay their bonuses . 12 educators chose to stand trial . The trail started in August 2014 .

Hall said: 'There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct.' Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. Yet, only one was allowed to remain free on bond ‚î teacher Shani Robinson ‚î because she is expecting to give birth soon. The jury reached its verdict on the eighth day of deliberations.

Verdict: Defense attorney Annette Greene reacts as the verdict is read for her client former Dunbar Elementary teacher Shani Robinson. Robinson and 10 other former Atlanta Public Schools educators were convicted for their part in a test cheating conspiracy that drew nationwide attention . Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of their students. Defense attorneys argued that their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable.

District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. It lasted nearly two years and involved hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. 'Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,' Howard said.

President Milos Zeman has been criticised by Ambassador Andrew Schapiro over his plans to attend the annual parade in Moscow, marking the Allied win at the Western front in 1945, despite the crisis in Ukraine. In response to the critique, President Zeman said Ambassador Schapiro is no longer welcome in the Prague Castle, the seat of presidency. Under attack: Czech President Milos Zeman was criticised by U.S. Ambassador Andrew Schapiro over his plans to attend the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, despite the crisis in Ukraine . Much to the chagrin of President Zeman, the country's prime minister together with Czech lawmakers are siding with the American. 'I think that the reaction of President Zeman was not adequate,' Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said. 'I would naturally welcome it if the attitude of Mr. President to foreign policy in general was a bit more professional,' Sobotka told the Czech public television on Monday. 'We should be able to communicate with our friends and allies,' Sobotka added. Parliament's lower house speaker, Jan Hamacek, said he thought Zeman was overreacting; the deputy speaker of Parliament's upper house, Premysl Sobotka, said Zeman demonstrated a lack of 'diplomatic thinking.' Harsh reaction: In response to the criticism, President Zeman has banned Ambassador Schapiro from visiting Prague Castle, the seat of presidency. Jan Mlejnek, an analyst, said Zeman's rhetoric was unfortunate and will harm Czech-U.S. relations. In an emailed statement from the U.S. embassy, Shapiro said 'it would be unfortunate for President Zeman to be there as perhaps? the only EU head of state.' Zeman, whose is critical of European Union sanctions against Russia, said he wanted to honor Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives to liberate his country in World War II. The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post and the government is in charge of foreign policy. Sobotka said he accepted Zeman's explanation for the trip. Shapiro said he regretted that President Zeman felt offended. 'I value a good working relationship with everyone, and I want him to know that my door will be open to him,'? Shapiro said. 'I also want the Czech people to know that the United States government, and the people of America, value our relationship as partners and allies more than ever.'

Grown-up children who are still in their family home are living the 'life of Riley' while unknowingly pushing their parents into debt, research shows. The so-called 'boomerang generation' are placing their parents under serious financial pressure by living at home even in their twenties and thirties. Now, debt organisations have warned that parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money towards household bills amid fears the British 'stiff upper lip' makes them reluctant to admit when they need help. Experts claim grown-up children still living at home are often completely unaware that they are forcing their parents further into debt. Research revealed that as many as three-quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them. But only 42 per cent charge their children rent ‚ with many admitting they feel too guilty and uncomfortable to ask. And even if they manage to ask their offspring to contribute, most charge them just £150 a month, compared with a typical UK rent of £750. On top of this, 80 per cent still buy their adult child's groceries, and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night, according to the study by website TopCashBack. Parents expressed concern that their children could not afford to move out or were struggling to save for a house deposit. But the survey found the average salary of a grown-up child living at home is £26,000, giving them a comfortable £1,000 in disposable income each month. Half of parents who did charge rent admitted they relied on that money to cover living expenses such as groceries and utility bills. Food for thought: Eight out of ten parents survey said they still bought their children's groceries for them . In fact, a second study released today revealed that many debt-ridden parents are falling into deeper financial trouble because of their stay-at-home children. According to debt management specialist PayPlan, a third of parents in debt who have grown-up children living at home have been forced to take out a loan to meet the costs of housing and feeding them. Young adults brought up on the internet are beset by loneliness because they make friends online rather than face to face, a survey reveals. It found many of the so-called Facebook generation of internet-obsessed people in their late teens, twenties and early thirties say they feel lonely. One in seven of those who find it hard to make friends are too scared to talk to strangers. Their fear of relationships appears linked to how they usually communicate ‚ by text, Facebook and email. But unlike older generations they seem to have no time or inclination to talk to their neighbours. The survey of nearly 2,500 people by The Big Lunch community campaign undermines the idea that loneliness mostly affects the elderly. Dr Rebecca Harris of the University of Bolton, who worked on the poll, said: 'Our brains treat loneliness the same as physical pain. We're spending less time having social interaction, we have fewer friends than we'd like and we're finding it harder to make new friends.' But half of these parents say they still refuse to ask their kids to contribute to the household pot. Jane Clack, of PayPlan, said: 'In this country we are renowned for a stiff upper lip, but the truth is that many parents are under emotional strain as a result of their debts.'",200,128,"children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.",Parents debt are increasing by letting their adult children's expenses.

A candidate hoping to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky claims he was arrested for not returning an overdue library book. Johnathan Masters, 33, was pulled over by a state trooper on Wednesday and apparently taken to jail over a book he withdrew 11 years ago. Masters - who says the charge is nonsense - claims the officer initially pulled him over for having expired tax stickers on his car . An online booking record for Masters says only that he was arrested for an outstanding warrant. But he says he was told the reason was a theft charge, linked to allegedly borrowing the book and never giving it back, the Huffington Post reported. Masters denies the apparent charge - theft by failure to make required disposition of property - and says he will clear his name in court. Defending himself to Fox News, he said he had never even withdrawn a library book in Kenton County, where he claims the charge originates. Of the arrest, Masters said: 'I thought he was going to let me go because he was real friendly, but then he went back to his patrol car and was gone for about 15 minutes. 'When he came back, he asked me, ""Did you take out a library book 11 years ago?"" 'I started to laugh, but he said, ""This is serious!"" and he took me to jail for three hours. I plan to fight the charges.' Masters was let out of jail after paying a $100 bond, and is expected to appear in court later this month. He has been beset by legal troubles since his candidacy emerged. He is the running-mate of Geoff Young, who mounted a failed bid for Congress in 2014. Governor's race: Masters is running with Geoff Young, left, in the Democratic primary against front-runner Jack Conway, the state's Attorney General (right) The two hope to defeat front runner Jack Conway, the state Attorney General, in the Democratic primary elections this May. As part of his campaign, Young issued a lawsuit against Conway and other leading Democrats, accusing them of ignoring his campaign to secure victory in the primary.

According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, Masters is also waiting for his day in court on harassment charges. He is accused of making expletive-laden calls to an associate dean at Spalding University, demanding his money back after being kicked out of the school. The paper also reported that there is a pending arrest warrant over claims he threatened to beat up a principal after being told he couldn't enter a school to conduct a survey. He reportedly yelled 'come out here so I can kick your ass' in the December 17 visit. He has yet to be served with the warrant in the second case. Masters runs a political blog called The Freedom Skool. His entries include several long posts about the medicinal benefits of marijuana, and a string of multi-colored, edited photographs of his running-mate. In response to the harassment charges, Patrick Hughes, chairman of the Kentucky Democrats, told the Courier-Journal that Masters and Young 'don't have a snowball's chance' of victory. Speaking to Daily Mail Online today, Young said he is 'standing behind' Masters despite the accusations.

But for Karla Kirby, 38, her pregnancy is simply filled with gleeful anticipation of giving her new baby away. For the chef, who lives in north Lincolnshire, is currently pregnant with her eleventh child, and as a surrogate mother, has already waved goodbye to ten biological children of her own. Karla Kirby with two of her own children, Jordan and Joshua, and some of the children she ahs given birth to as a surrogate mother . In an interview with The Mirror, Karla said she decided to become a surrogate as she loved motherhood and was keen to help other people have a family of their own. With two children of her own, and in her late teens, she overheard a conversation where people were discussing surrogacy and decided to contact the organisation Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy (COTS) to find out more. After a counselling session to make sure she was ready, she opted to be a 'straight surrogate' using her own eggs and the intended father's sperm which she artificially inseminated herself. Karla chose to help a couple where the wife was infertile, and became pregnant after the eighth attempt, with her first surrogate child, Ethan, in 2001. She said seeing the emotion on the new parents' faces when she handed over the baby helped her realise she had made the right decision and 18 months later, became a surrogate again, going on to give birth to Nia in 2002 and Carey in 2003. Her own two children, who were now aged six and seven, always knew the children she was carrying would not be part of their family and there was no stopping her. Karla (right) and her wife, Taz, with one of the surrogate children immediately after the birth . Close: Karla said she is aware Taz worries about her health and would like her to retire from surrogacy . 'I had Macey in 2005, Maddie in 2007, Tyler in 2008, George in 2009, Hayden in 2011, Saskia in 2013 and Oliver in 2014 - the parents all name their own babies,' she told The Mirror. Karla has bounced back quickly from each drug-free birth, although at 29 weeks pregnant, she is currently facing the prospect of delivering her 11th surrogate child via caesarian section due to a low lying placenta. Karla married her partner Taz last summer and praised her for her support during the last three pregnancies, although she said she was aware that her new wife would like her to retire from surrogacy. She said it was strange to know there were ten children out there who shared her genes and she kept in touch with some of them including George and Macey who were flower girl and pageboy at her wedding. However, she said while she was aware that each pregnancy brought with it additional health risks, she was not ready to give up. 'What I do helps to make people's dreams come true - you just can't put a price on that,' she added.

Families in the UK are more indebted than those in many other major developed nations, said the International Monetary Fund ‚ mainly due to borrowing to buy expensive homes. The UK was singled out as having a problem with household debt, along with Portugal ‚ lumping Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisis. Families in the UK are more indebted than those in many other major developed nations, said the International Monetary Fund . The findings, in the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report, are a stark reminder that the recovery remains fragile. 'High debt levels in the private sector continue to hinder growth and financial stability,' the report said. 'Gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other advanced economies.' Soaring house prices have pushed up household debt in Britain in recent years ‚ raising fears that families are over-stretching themselves to get on the property ladder or buy a bigger home. The Bank of England has clamped down on the sort of risky mortgage lending that was rife in the build-up to the financial crisis, in an effort to prevent another housing boom and bust. But the IMF said: 'Containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.' It also said 'measures to increase housing supply are a priority' for the UK given the shortage of homes and swelling population. Both the Tories and Labour have promised to step-up house building after the General Election. IMF figures showed household debt in the UK was worth 87.1 per cent of gross domestic product, or total economic output, last year. That compares with 82.6 per cent in Portugal and 76.9 per cent in the United States. Debt levels are far lower in much of Europe, at 72 per cent in Spain, around 55 per cent in Germany and France, and just over 40 per cent in Italy. Douro River, Porto, Portugal: The IMF report lumped Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisis . A separate report will today claim 13million Britons will dive further into debt this year ‚ a 40 per cent rise on 2014. The survey of 2,000 people found that, of the two-thirds of British adults already in debt from credit cards, overdrafts and loans, a quarter will have to borrow even more to cope. Kevin Mountford of MoneySuperMarket.com, which was behind the research, said: 'It's important that those relying on credit keep in control of the situation, so their debt doesn't spiral out of control. 'Simply working out a realistic monthly budget and cutting out unnecessary expenditure should be the first step.' THE cost of moving house has soared to £12,000, figures show. Rising estate agents' fees, removal costs and stamp duty helped push the total bill up 60 per cent between 2004 and last year ‚ double the inflation rate. And it is forecast to hit £15,000 in five years despite recent reforms to curb stamp duty costs. The sky-high price of moving does not include the deposit ‚ £90,000 for the average buyer. Experts said it could be putting families off moving house at a time when demand for properties has already fallen away. A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found the bill for moving typically includes more than £5,000 in estate agents' fees, £3,600 in stamp duty and £1,400 in solicitors' conveyancing bills.

News of the birth, which was announced yesterday, has been greeted with joy by the followers of the Aga Khan, who, in a statement, spoke of his family's 'great happiness'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Princess Salwa Aga Khan, pictured during a photo shoot last year, has given birth to a son . Ms Spears, a Seattle-born supermodel who has starred in campaigns for Diane von Furstenburg and Chanel among others, married Prince Rahim Aga Khan in 2013 following a four month engagement. The model, 26, had been considered 'the next Cindy Crawford' by her agency Ford Models, but has put her career on the back-burner since becoming wife to the 44-year-old royal. She follows in the footsteps of a string of American royal wives, among them actress Rita Hayworth who was married to Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan. Prince Rahim's younger brother Hussein, 41, also married an American, although his marriage to New Yorker Kristin White, 38, ended shortly after his brother's wedding in 2013.

A British business magnate and a racehorse enthusiast, he is responsible for adding to the family fortune, which is thought to amount to more than $800m.

A crowd of onlookers gathered outside the memorial. Some snapped photos of the royal visitor, while one boy held a sign celebrating the prince's hair color: ""Red Heads Rule!"" During his time down under, Harry ""will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,"" the Australian Defence Forces said last week. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, according to a royal spokesman.

Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be ""challenging."" It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities such as physical training and pack marches. Another focus of Harry's visit is to spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia.

The rate of bankruptcy, 15.7percent - remained the same no matter how long the players were in the league or how well they were paid, according to researchers from the California Institute of Technology, George Washington University and the University of Washington. Despite earning millions of dollars - sometimes tens of millions - former players go broke at about 1.1percent per year, the same rate as the rest of Americans. Bleak future: Despite NFL players earning millions - sometimes times of millions - over the course of their careers, nearly 16percent of players are bankrupt within 12 years . Vince Young earned a reported $64million in salary and endorsement deals - but was bankrupt before he even finished his NFL career. Widely reported rumors say he spent $5,000 a week at Cheesecake factory . Though bleak, the 15.7percent figure found by the researchers, is dramatically lower than a widely quoted statistic that 78percent of retired players are bankrupt or under 'financial stress' within two years of leaving the league. The figure comes from a 2009 survey by Sports Illustrated. Often, when athletes go broke, it's because of unimaginable extravagances, bad investments and massive child support payments. This, despite the fact that the average player makes $3.2million over the course of a career. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL and made more than $82million. He retired in 2007 and filed for bankruptcy in 2012 - citing several failed business ventures. Bankruptcy remained at similar rates even among players who had long, profitable careers in the sport - though it was highest for those who stayed in the league for five years - and lower for those who were in it for more than a decade . Michael Vick, who made more than $130million, is still playing has he attempts to pay off his $18million bankruptcy debt from 2008 . When his estate was sold at auction, he had a lionskin rug and 240 pairs of sneakers. He also owed more than $75,000 a month in child support for his six children (with five different women,) Quarterback Vince Young's played his last NFL game in December 2011. He filed for bankruptcy in January 2014 - despite earning $34million in salary and another $30million in endorsement deals. Widely reported rumors that emerged after he first began having financial trouble in 2012 claim that he spent up to $5,000 a week at Cheesecake Factory and racked up a $6,000 tab at TGI Friday's. Young also blamed investment advisers who he claimed took advantage of him. Quarterback Michael Vick filed for bankruptcy in 2008 - in the middle of his high-profile career and legal troubles that sent him to prison. He was still paying off his $18million in debts in 2014 - despite making $130million from the NFL and millions more from endorsement deals. 'We've known that it can be very difficult for the average family to save,' Cal Tech finance professor Colin F. Camerer, one of the researchers, told the Washington Post. 'But this is one group that you might think ought to be able to avoid bankruptcy. They're in a position to buy some good advice if they need it. But even for them, with all these millions, it's a challenge.'",217,247,"club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","tax, average, benefits, people, rate, increase, rise, budget, cuts, rates,","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","rise of taxes, increased benefits, expenses, budget increase, average people's budget, decreased rates, taxes benefit average people","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.","This topic is about a rise of taxes benefitting average people, with increased benefits despite their expenses due to a budget increase and decreased consumer goods rates.","The NFL is comprised of a number of different football teams.

521,3XUHV3NRVM0FQRPBID1R37DAZLCH5X,895b12bbb9419ad45d012ea89b8bf014e7bd975d,"At least 15 Fortune 500 companies, many of them worth north of a $1 billion, paid zero income taxes in 2014, says a report out last week from the Citizens for Tax Justice. According to the report, household names like CBS, General Electric and Mattel all successfully manipulated the U.S. tax code to avoid paying taxes on their massive profits. Even more shocking: some of them even received tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions. Avoidance: Fifteen Fortune 500 companies managed to get through 2014 without owing a penny in income taxes. What's more, most of those 15 were actually given federal tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions . CBS made $1.8 billion in U.S. profits last year and received a $235 million tax rebate . To put this harsh reality into perspective, imagine you're a taxpayer logged on to a tax site in your struggle to determine what you owe Uncle Sam. You pay upwards of $100 every month for the internet you're using and could well owe thousands in income tax. But if your monthly internet payment goes to Time Warner, guess what they'll be paying this year. That's right: zero dollars. In a way, you may have paid them. Again. The frequently maligned cable company made over $4 billion in U.S. profit last year and subsequently received tax rebates totaling $26 million. And, as Fast Company notes, it's all perfectly legal. One method used by these companies is called accelerated depreciation, which means the tax value of an asset may be claimed in the first years of the purchase rather than over time. Another method of tax avoidance is active financing. Put simply, this means a company classifies a taxable activity as foreign financing, putting it out of reach of the IRS. With corporate giants like Pepco, Prudential and Xerox all successfully avoiding paying income tax, Citizens for Tax Justice says American taxpayers and the U.S. government need to wake up and amend the tax code. The report's authors write: . 'As Congress focuses on strategies for revamping the U.S. corporate income tax, a sensible starting point should be to critically assess the costs of each of these tax breaks and to take steps to ensure that profitable corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.' Fair? Citizens for Tax Justice wants changes to the corporate tax code and released a report last week that lists the Fortune 500 corporations that managed to squeak by in 2014 without paying a dime in income tax . Jetblue, PG&E, PEPCO Holdings and Ryder used accelerated depreciation, a tax break that allows companies to write off the cost of their capital investments much faster than these investments wear out, to dramatically reduce their tax rates . Priceline relied heavily on a single tax break ‚î writing off the value of executive stock options for tax purposes ‚î to zero out its tax liability not just in 2014 but in 2013, 2012 and 2011 as well. In addition, the company admits that this tax break could offset all taxes on up to $1.2 billion in profits going forward. Mattel also reports enjoying $140 million in stock option tax breaks over the past five years. Qualcomm has enjoyed more than $290 million in research and development tax breaks over the past three years. The R&E tax credit has been criticized for rewarding companies for ""research"" they would have done anyway, as well as rewarding research in areas such as fast-food packaging. General Electric uses the active financing tax break as one of many ways that it eliminates its U.S. income tax bill. This arcane tax break allows some multinational financial institutions to avoid paying income taxes to any government on their international financing activities.

Citizens for Tax Justice want to change the corporate tax code to insure that these large companies aren't able to game the system like this in the future and allow the taxes that should be paid to benefit the average people that made it possible with their time, labor, and purchases.",Some Fortune 500 companies received funds from the IRS though they used the current tax laws to evade paying any income tax.

Jade Wimsey, 24, from Goole, East Yorkshire, would down up to seven cans a day at more than £1.50 a pop and totalling more than 1,540 calories. Her fizz addiction caused her weight to rocket to 17st 6lb. She is now a slim size 12 having shed six stone in 18 months by kicking the energy fuel for good. Jade Wimsey went from a size 12 to 20 in four years as she guzzled up to seven cans of energy drinks a day . 'I never associated energy drinks with gaining weight. I didn't really consider the hidden calorie or sugar content in them,' said Jade, who runs a blog called girlupnorth.co.uk. 'In fact, some energy drinks brands say the beverage speeds up your metabolism so I figured it was alright for me!' Jade's weight made her the victim of cruel jibes by male customers at the bar she worked at. She was even humiliated for her size by bullies on Facebook. 'I would down so many cans per day without thinking about it. Ditching energy drinks - alongside a healthy eating plan - made an astonishing difference to my weight.' Growing up, Jade had always lived a healthy lifestyle, eating home-cooked meals prepared by her mother. But that changed after she started university. Living away from home, Jade soon developed a taste for fast food and became hooked on energy drinks. Jade has reached her goal weight of 11 stone 6.5lbs after losing six stone from kicking her fizzy habit . 'Like most university students when they leave home for the first time, I started eating more takeaways and ready meals. 'Around the same time, I also discovered energy drinks. I loved the sweet taste of them and the caffeine kick they gave. 'Soon, I was relying on cans of the stuff to get me through the day. It got to the point where an energy drink was the first thing I drank when I got out of bed in the morning. 'I would insist on a can with every meal and then have a few extra as a snack. 'If I was driving, I'd down an energy drink. Then when I'd stopped at the petrol station, I'd pick up two more cans of the stuff. 'I would buy a can whenever I could get hold of one. If there was an offer on energy drinks, I would stock up on them. 'I could easily spend £10.50 on cans per day.' The 24-year-old from Yorkshire became the victim of cruel jibes as she ballooned to nearly 18 stone . In September 2013, she joined Slimming World, began a healthy diet and cut out energy drinks for good . Consuming between five to seven energy drinks every day, Jade piled on the pounds. She went from being a slim size 12/14 to a size 18. 'In my head, I thought it was fine to drink so many energy drinks. I never thought it would have any impact on my weight. 'But in reality, I was slurping all these empty calories.' Jade's fizzy beverage habit continued after she left university. Her graduate job as a bar supervisor allowed her to slurp energy drinks throughout the day. 'When I was working at the bar during the weekend, I would drink about seven energy drinks in a shift. 'I could take a can from the bar whenever I wanted and it helped me get through a busy night shift.' Jade was drinking so many cans of energy drinks that it became a running joke with friends and family. She explained: 'My mates at work were always commenting about how many cans I had. 'Most of my family knew that I was really quite addicted to them too.' By the age of 22, Jade's weight had crept up to size 20 and her shape was affecting her confidence. 'I resigned myself to being the 'fat one' in my group of slim friends. I didn't like going out because I felt uncomfortable in clothes and I couldn't find anything that fitted me. 'My size stopped me from living my life to the full and socialising as much as I would have liked to.' 'I never associated energy drinks with gaining weight. I didn't really consider the hidden calorie or sugar content in them,' said Jade . Jade's weight also made her the victim of nasty comments and jibes. 'I felt self-conscious about how big I was,' she said. 'Working at the bar, a lot of the other female staff were bought drinks by male customers. But no one ever bought me a drink because I guess people thought I was unattractive. 'There were also a few occasions when men at the bar made unpleasant remarks about my appearance. 'But the final straw was when I came across someone's cruel Facebook status about me 'never having my head out of the fridge'. 'I was hurt but I decided that I was going to make changes in my life so that nobody could ever make me feel that way again.' As she started losing the weight, Jade started to get compliments and told she smiled a lot more now . The awful incident forced Jade to face her weight gain head-on. In September 2013, she joined Slimming World, began a healthy diet and cut out energy drinks for good. She explains: 'From the get-go, I decided I would go cold turkey on energy drinks. 'Quitting was difficult at first, I experienced a dip in energy and waking up in the morning without my normal kick was tough. 'But I found ways to cope with the withdrawal symptoms. For instance, I would keep a few healthy snacks with me when I was working a long shift at the bar so I wouldn't turn to a can. 'And I also really enjoyed the Slimming World diet. I felt I was eating delicious, homemade food again.' The pounds fell away and within four months, Jade had lost 2.5 stone. 'I started getting compliments about how I looked and friends started commenting about how much more I smiled now.' Snacks and drinks . 5 to 7 cans of energy drink per day and a chocolate bar . Breakfast . Chocolate biscuit or bar . Lunch . White bread sandwich and crisps . Dinner . Takeaway or ready meal . Snacks and drinks . Water and Diet Coke . Breakfast . Yoghurt and fruit . Lunch .

She said she has more energy now than ever before! In January this year, Jade reached her goal weight of 11 stone and 6.5 lbs and she loves her new-found confidence. 'I feel like myself again. I actually want to go out and socialise now whereas before I'd think of any excuse to stay at home. 'I get drinks bought for me when I'm working at the bar now too!' Jade - who is married to pub landlord, Jason, 44 - wants to help others lose weight through her blog. She explains: 'I feel the sky is the limit now.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 74-year-old former steel worker who has ruled the oil-producing nation since 1989, has won another five year term. Kazakh television showed a triumphant Nazarbayev walking on a red carpet, smiling and shaking hands and greeting thousands of jubilant supporters at a forum in the capital Astana. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been re-elected as president of Kazakhstan after winning 97 per cent of the vote . But international monitors have voiced their concern about the poll saying there was not a genuine choice of other candidates with most of his vocal opponents either being jailed or fled abroad. However, at a news conference, Nazarbayev said: 'I apologise that for super-democratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. 'If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?' The election was called more than a year before Nazarbayev's term was due to end, averting the risk that another year of economic pain could develop into a more serious challenge to his leadership. It also puts the question of a possible successor, an important issue for investors, off the table for now. Kazakhstan has been criticised by the West and human rights bodies for crackdowns on dissent. No election held there has yet been given a clean bill of health by monitors. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping promptly congratulated Nazarbayev on his re-election. Nazarbayev told a news conference after his victory that if he had interfered in the vote, it would have been undemocratic . Meanwhile Nazarbayev has promoted market reforms in the country and attracted $200 billion in foreign direct investment, turning his nation of 17 million into the second-largest economy in the former Soviet Union and number two post-Soviet oil producer after Russia. The multi-ethnic, mainly Muslim country is stable in a region troubled by ethnic violence from Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan. Nazarbayev has promoted 'a multi-vector policy', building good ties with neighbouring Russia and China as well as the United States and the European Union. But the economy has been hurt in the past year by the decline in global energy prices and by economic difficulty in neighbouring Russia, hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine.

One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students . Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month . Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, 'Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?' Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial . Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having sex with three boys . Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students.

According to the White House, only if the President of the United States says it is. That's infuriating Republicans and even some Democrats, who are demanding that the Obama administration submit any final nuclear deal with Iran to Congress for approval. ""This is clearly a treaty,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday. ""They can call it a banana, but it's a treaty."" Kerry denounces GOP letter to Iran leaders . The GOP position could jeopardize the long-term survival of any Iran deal, and it represents the party's newest clash with President Barack Obama over the limits of executive authority, as Republicans object to a pact they warn could eventually give Tehran a nuclear bomb. It's that skepticism that has largely led the White House to define the deal as a ""nonbinding agreement"" rather than a ""treaty,"" which the Constitution requires Senate ""advice and consent"" on. The distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out Congress -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law. While Republicans call foul, the administration defends the differentiation as perfectly sound, and no surprise. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed Wednesday that the administration never intended to negotiate a treaty. ""We've been clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement,"" he said at a Senate hearing. That doesn't sit well with Republicans, many of whom believe the Senate's constitutional role is being bypassed. Idaho Sen. James Risch dismissed the administration's argument: ""Let there be no mistake, this is a treaty that is being negotiated. It's a treaty and should be treated as such."" Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? Republicans see criticism of the administration's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal, and to push their larger assault on the White House's exercise of power. At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul explicitly tied the administration's bid to keep the deal away from Congress to other accusations of White House overreach. ""This is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their purview, whether it be immigration, whether it be health care,"" he charged, noting that he had joined 46 other GOP senators in signing a letter to the Islamic Republic informing them of Congress's role in approving binding agreements. ""I signed the letter to Iran. But you know what? The message I was sending was to you,"" he told Kerry. ""I signed it to an administration that doesn't listen, to an administration that, every turn, tries to go around Congress because you think you can't get your way."" But legal experts say that though a court challenge along the lines of pending GOP cases on immigration and health care is possible in theory, it would be a long shot. There is no currently no suit on the issue being discussed on Capitol Hill, and it's far from clear that Republicans would be standing on firm legal ground with such a challenge. The debate, rumbling for decades, has yet to be definitively resolved in case law. ""It is a very interesting question,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former senior U.S. diplomat, arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the United States to commitments under international law; i.e., a treaty, or a less stringent arrangement. Senators grill Obama officials on Iran . Jim Walsh, a specialist on the Iran nuclear program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Iran deal, which commits the United States to waive or lift sanctions, does not rise to the level of a formal treaty. ""Treaties traditionally have involved reductions in armaments, nuclear weapons, conventional forces. They require us to take something away that we have already built or established."" In this case, the United States would lift sanctions, but would not be changing its military posture. ""We have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by Congress,"" Walsh said. But David Rivkin, a constitutional and international law expert who worked for President George H.W. Bush, said that any international agreement requiring major undertakings on the part of the United States -- such as the proposed Iran deal -- must be sent to the Senate for advice and consent. ""The Constitution is quite clear,"" he said. Republicans point to none less than the vice president of the United States to bolster their case. When Vice President Joe Biden was a senator in 2002, he wrote a letter to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with Russia constituted a treaty subject to Senate approval since it would require ""significant obligations by the United States."" But Biden's 2002 letter didn't keep him from unleashing his fury at the GOP letter to Iran on Monday. ""Around the world, America's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments,"" Biden said in a statement. While Congress approves some agreements, ""as the authors of this letter must know, the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval."" Indeed, in the letter he penned to Iran, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton acknowledged that the administration could seek a mere ""executive agreement"" free of congressional review. Obama, Iranian official slam GOP letter on deal . Presidents claim inherent powers to conclude executive agreements under Article II of the Constitution. U.S. law stipulates that an agreement is only viewed as a treaty once it has been made with ""the advice and consent of the Senate,"" a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted. But administrations often choose to conclude deals with foreign states that don't satisfy that requirement. Such an ""executive agreement"" is still considered a treaty that is binding under international law, but does not reach the same standard under U.S. law, according to the study. Examples of ""nonbinding"" documents include a U.S.-Russia to remove Syria's stocks of chemical weapons and the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop the global shipment of the weapons of mass destruction components. Biden argued Monday that this practice is as old as the United States itself. ""Under presidents of both parties, such major shifts in American foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China, the resolution of the Iran hostage crisis, and the conclusion of the Vietnam War were all conducted without congressional approval,"" he said in his statement opposing the GOP letter. The White House would clearly prefer a binding agreement with Iran, which would have a better chance of longevity. But the strength of opposition in Congress makes that route impossible. According to Republicans such as Cotton, the only deal the Senate would approve is one that completely bans Iranian uranium enrichment. Obama has said that goal is simply not realistic. So Republicans, dissatisfied with what's emerging from negotiations, are seizing on the vulnerability of a deal that lacks treaty status. Many see that as a more viable path for disruption than the case on administration overreach. ""If Congress doesn't approve this deal, Congress won't accept this deal, now or in the future,"" Cotton told CNN. In the letter, he informed Iranian leaders that many senators will serve terms longer than Obama, so they would have to reckon with the Senate at some point. Lawmakers can refuse to lift sanctions down the road or try to choke off funds for the deal's implementation. The administration acknowledges that Congress will have to get involved at some point. Obama currently has the power to lift or waive certain sanctions against Iran for the duration of his presidency and encourage U.S. international partners to follow suit. But he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by Congress, which include some of the most punitive measures against Iran. ""Part of the agreement is going to involve sanctions relief to the Iranian government that is meted out over time,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told CNN. ""At some time in the duration of this agreement, Congress will have to be heard on sanctions relief."" Senior U.S. officials have acknowledged that the clamor among lawmakers for a role, as well as their public criticisms, also implicitly highlights the vulnerability of their case and an ultimate agreement. Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia who has signed onto a bill calling for the White House to put any deal up for a vote in Congress, said that Obama is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point. ""It is not a treaty. If it were a treaty, there is a clear process. It would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate."" But Kaine told CNN on Wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by Congress are bargained away to ensure Iran sticks to limits on its nuclear program. ""Congress has got to weigh in at some point,"" Kaine said.",162,175,"president, obama, white, house, barack, bush, washington, administration, american, states,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, here in America, White House press conference, the Bush administration, the former Republican president,","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the country's president, ruler of the country, President Barack Obama, the White House press conference, the Bush administration, and the former Republican president.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.","According to White House, only if the President of the United States says it is.

A crooked builder befriended a widowed pensioner so he could fritter away her £28,500 life savings on shopping sprees and lavish meals out. Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered the elderly woman's accounts before spending tens of thousands of pounds on trips to the Snowdome and in shops such as Argos and HMV. He even persuaded his victim to change her will so he could reap the benefits, before secretly taking out two life insurance policies, both of which named him as the beneficiary. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months after admitting charges of fraud and theft. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said Donohoe abused the woman's trust in 'every conceivable way'. Judge Francis Laird QC said: 'You befriended her, you became a close friend and confidante. Because of your behaviour towards her she absolutely trusted you with her financial affairs. 'You abused that trust. You did so in every conceivable way. She effectively handed over her money to you. You were not a financial advisor. 'However she was an elderly lady, a widow, alone and highly vulnerable to a dishonest individual such as yourself.' The court was told how Donohoe had first befriended the woman when he carried out work on her property in Tyseley in 2007. By January 2011, he had started controlling the woman's finances. During that time, he applied for credit cards in her name and also ran up huge debts. The court heard how the victim also changed her will twice during Donohoe's two-year scam, leaving everything to the defendant. But the widow was unaware that Donohoe had taken out the life insurance policies. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said Donohoe used the money on trips to the Snowdome as well as on meals and at shops. But Department of Work and Pensions checks soon discovered that the woman's accounts were overdrawn, prompting social services to become involved. A judge at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) said Donohoe abused the woman's trust 'in every conceivable way'. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months, after admitting theft and fraud . It led to Donohoe being arrested. Police found him in possession of four credit cards, as well as a raft of documentation, in the widow's name. In a statement after the case, the victim said: 'I thought he was a good person but I was wrong. As a result of what Sean did to me I was left with no money and worried about paying my bills months after. I am still shocked and upset that he stole thousands of pounds.' Nicholas Berry, defending, said Donohoe was suffering from anxiety and depression after the break-up of a previous relationship and had got into a financial troubles through gambling. 'He was spiralling into debt and owed his father a lot of money. At that time, quite clearly, he saw the opportunity to fleece the victim in an appalling manner,' he said.",128,195,"money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","A 30 year older builder has stolen from an elderly widow.

This is according to US scientists who have found subtle changes in the former president's speech during his term in office from 1981 to 1989. Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, and always maintained that he would resign from his post if his mental health went into decline. Scroll down for video . Long before he was diagnoised with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental condition, according to a new study by the University of Arizona. This image was taken in 1991 in California, just three years before the President was diagnosed with dementia . Early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain. Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004. In 2010, a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son Ron, that he saw early signs of dementia in 'an out-of-touch president' during the 1984 campaign. He says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar California canyons he was flying over. This didn't stop his adversaries claiming his tendency to forget names and make contradictory statements was the result dementia. Now researchers at the University of Arizona believe Reagan was suffering from the early onset of Alzheimer's while acting as president. They came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that Reagan held to the 101 sessions George H. W. Bush held in his term. 'Key word counts previously associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease were extracted and regression analyses were conducted,' the authors wrote. Reagan used words such as 'thing' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often Bush. He also used more repetition. The team used a new algorithm based on a technique used by others to analyse changes in writing by novelists, according to a report in the New York Times. 'President Reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time,' the researchers said. 'There was no significant trend in these features for President Bush,' they added. The findings, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, do not conclusively prove that Reagan had dementia that affected his judgment as president.

But the scientists involved in the project hope the technique will help reveal signs of Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases much earlier. Early detection could slow the progression of the disease before it severely damages the brain. Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004. In 2010, a book marking the 100th anniversary of his birth included claims by his son Ron, that he saw early signs of dementia in 'an out-of-touch president' during the 1984 campaign. The telltale signs of Alzheimer's can be seen in people as young as 20, research shows. The 'unprecedented' finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop. This is a 'much younger age than the scientists ever imagined'. The discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages, when it is easiest to treat, and even stopping the disease in its tracks. However, British experts cautioned that the research is still at an early stage. Crucially, it isn't known how many people who have the early signs of Alzheimer's in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease. Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages. He says he saw those signs again in 1986 where he claimed his father could not remember the names of the familiar California canyons he was flying over. While some people suggest they knew Reagan had the disease while in office, his four White House doctors said they saw no evidence of it. Alzheimer's is an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells. Mr Reagan informed the nation in a hand written letter when he was formally diagnosed.

They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line, followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel. Most-loathed: A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most.

Asked about their frustration with such charges, 48 per cent said they should be free, while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden.

New indie music was first piped into the cabin - during boarding and disembarking - a few months ago and has quickly become a hit with passengers. In fact, many have taken to Twitter to share their approval of the new on board playlists, which feature rockers such as The xx, Haim, Phantogram and Hozier. American Airlines is targeting a younger demographic with the introduction of their new 'indie' cabin playlists . According to BuzzFeed News, on an internal blog, American Airlines representative, Barbara Delollis, discussed the company's decision. 'For 2015, they sought out a style of music that's upbeat yet not distracting, helps American stand out from the competition and appeals to younger generations,' she wrote. And it takes a lot for a track to make the cut. According to Delollis, the songs aren't just those 'you might find on the iPad/Spotify of a Gen Xer or Millenial. Foster The People is just one of many indie rock bands that are included on American Airlines' new playlists . Tracks from Hozier (left) and Lykke Li (right) were also hand selected to be played on board the flights . While boarding and while disembarking, specially selected indie rock music will now be piped into the cabin . The change comes on the heels of unfavourable customer feedback about the airline's previous cabin music, which were instrumental piano versions of pop songs. Brian Richardson, senior manager of American's in-flight entertainment and connectivity, also shared his thoughts about the switch on the same internal blog. 'The instrumental versions of pop songs had become tired and people were ready for a change,' he added. One Twitter user was especially excited to hear one of her favourite bands, Phantogram, on board . Washed Out, or Ernest Greene, is an electronica singer-songwriter and record producer from Georgia . Hozier's Take Me to Church was one of the biggest songs of the year - and can now be heard on board . Phantogram (left) and The xx (right) are two of the featured artists on American Airlines new cabin playlists . One customer mused that boarding his American Airlines flight felt like heading into a trendy nightclub . For this Twitter user, the best part of his flight was the boarding music playlist - and arriving safely, of course .

After the event at Washington's Howard University on Tuesday, Obama sat down with me for a one-on-one interview. I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away, as well as how enforceable his action plan is. Here are five things I learned: . The President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 (he transferred to Columbia University his junior year). While in L.A., he said, the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside. He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside. He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans ""a lot"" healthier, in addition to being able to ""see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog."" Obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken. Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. The EPA estimates that, between 1970 and 2010, the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone. ""No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,"" the President told me. When I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health, he said, ""We know as temperatures rise, insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up. We know, in a very straight-forward fashion, that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase, and so what we're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts, that people recognize there's a very personal, potential impact in climate change, and the good news is we can do something about it."" In many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health. When asked what the average American can do about all this, the President encouraged ordinary citizens, doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials ""to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change."" He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week ""to better understand, communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities."" The average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint, including: . ‚¢ Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights. One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime. If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs, we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half. ‚¢ Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this practice can save $100 a year on your energy bill. ‚¢ Use a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor in their design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop. ‚¢ Filter your own water. Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store. ‚¢ Adjust your curtains and thermostats. If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter, you can save big bucks on your energy bill. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home. Obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act. He said he believes the statute is ""clear and straightforward."" He said, ""I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision."" At issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not. Obama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld, however, there is no Plan B. ""Millions of people would lose their health insurance. They would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that's being provided out there."" Obama went on to say, ""I think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against [the Affordable Care Act] for ideological reasons."" He told me that he ""gets letters every day from people who say, 'you know what, the Affordable Care Act saved my life or saved my kid's life because I got insurance.' 'I thought I was healthy; turns out I had a tumor, but because I went and got a checkup, it was removed in time, and I'm now cancer-free.' "" He added, ""I think stories like that will be factored in when the Supreme Court takes a look at this case.""

Most people were not aware of the solution to climate change through this act. After it was instated the smog got better and lower rates of respiratory illness and deaths improved.,The other act the Obama pushed was the affordable care act. He explained that the Supreme Court would not challenge it. The Supreme Court left it up to states to put it in place or not. Obama stated that he received many letters that said they were grateful for the Affordable Care Act because they got insurance and it most likely saved their life.

The bill, which passed 92 to 8, also includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program. The issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah called passage of the bill a ""major, major accomplishment."" ""Tonight, the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, common sense-defying Medicare reimbursement system,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee just before the final vote.

Senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary ""doc fix"" had already expired. Some conservative senators, including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas, balked at the more than $200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset. The bill, ""institutionalizes and expands Obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""Any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to Medicare."" But that amendment was defeated, as were several others from each party that came up for votes. Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio warned the Senate not to change the bill. ""Unless the Senate passes the House-passed 'doc fix,' significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow,"" Boehner said.

Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down the Twitter posts. At an extraordinary pre-trial hearing, the Old Etonian former diplomat was accused of posting the tweets to 'ingratiate himself' with voters by 'whipping up local feeling' about the forthcoming case concerning the killing of a teenager. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down Twitter posts a court case . Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls. The trial, due to take place in June, was originally set for Bristol Crown Court, 30 miles from Gloucester. But after Mr Graham called for it to be moved during an exchange in the House of Commons and wrote to the Lord Chief Justice, it was transferred to Gloucester Crown Court. It was later switched back to in Bristol following objections that Gloucester would struggle to stage such an emotive case. Zac's family said they preferred the case to be heard in Bristol. The High Court heard concerns by defence lawyers that Mr Graham may have used his political influence to try to get the trial switched from Bristol. They also argued that a number of his Twitter posts could prejudice the trial if not removed from his Twitter account. Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls . Barrister Stephen Kamlish QC, acting for the defendant in the murder trial, said in court that Mr Graham's tweets were a 'clear attempt to win votes by ingratiating himself with his electors', the MP was 'potentially out of control on the issue' and if he refused to remove his tweets or added to them, the defendant may not get a fair trial. Mr Justice Hamblen ordered Mr Graham to remove the tweets 'as soon as reasonably practicable', and to say nothing more that could prejudice the trial. Mr Graham insisted he was right to speak out about the trial arrangements, but refused to discuss his tweets, which he said had been removed. On the suggestion that he had used the trial for electioneering, he said: 'That's rubbish. 'For an MP not to say anything about an event which filled the cathedral [for Zac's funeral]... no MP is going to sit there and say nothing.' A spokesman for the judiciary said: 'The presiding judge for the area, in consultation with the resident judge, felt it was appropriate to try this case in Gloucester.

The 19-time champion won the 2007 running on Butler's Cabin and success aboard Cantlow would be a fairytale start to what could be McCoy's final week as a jockey. He has vowed to immediately retire if he wins Saturday's Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on favourite Shutthefrontdoor, the gelding which won last year's Irish National under Barry Geraghty. AP McCoy will attempt to win the Irish Grand National on Cantlow in his final race meeting in Ireland . That Cantlow disputes favouritism for Monday's race is largely due to the presence of McCoy on his back.

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012.

Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of £354,378 ‚ which was £38,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions. Sainsbury's also delivered a big boost to residents, as properties near the store were worth 10 per cent more (£24,506) than ones in the surrounding area that weren't near a branch.

Marcelo Bosch landed a long-range penalty in the final act of Sunday's showdown with Racing Metro to clinch a 12-11 victory that has set up a last-four trip to St Etienne's Stade Geoffroy-Guichard on April 18. Awaiting in the Champions Cup semi-finals are Clermont, who are bristling with confidence after their remarkable 37-5 rout of runaway Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton. Marcelo Bosch launches a long range penalty towards the posts with the final act of Saracens' quarter-final . The Argentinian centre is then mobbed by his team-mates after landing the match-winning kick . However, McCall believes that facing Clermont outside of their Stade Marcel-Michelin stronghold, where they have not lost in Europe since 2008, is a different proposition. 'Given Clermont's home record, it's bit of a relief to be playing them on neutral territory. We're still going to France, but it's not quite the same as going to their own ground,' McCall said. Saracens' prospects against the Top 14's second-placed team are likely to be improved by the return of centre Brad Barritt from an ankle injury, while there is an outside chance fly-half Owen Farrell could recover from his knee problem in time. 'We have some pretty tough fixtures coming up - Leicester next Saturday is a massive game for us and after Clermont we have Northampton in the Premiership,' McCall said. 'We have some players coming back and will have to spread the load during this period. Brad should be back for the Champions Cup semi-final, Owen is touch and go.' Northampton's players look shell-shocked after they were demolished by Clermont Auvergne . Saracens hardly sent shockwaves across the continent after dispatching Racing in an arm wrestle decided by Bosch's nerveless penalty, but McCall insists the result is all that matters. 'Sometimes the games are the way they are and we mustn't over analyse these things,' McCall said. 'We've come away to France and played a big, strong, very good team with outstanding half-backs, but we've won. 'We shouldn't worry too much about how we won, but just that we won and reached our third consecutive semi-final in this tough competition. That says a lot about the players we have. 'When you look at Ronan O'Gara at Munster and Jonny Sexton at Leinster, they lost quarters and semis over the years before they started winning them. Mark McCall watches on as Charlie Hodgson warms up before Sunday's dramatic European win . 'We lost the quarter to Clermont four years ago and the semis to Toulon two years ago, and you saw out there that Racing didn't really know how to win the game. 'They had this big strong wind they didn't use because of the pressure they were under, and that was down to our team.' Racing's Jamie Roberts expects to end speculation over his future this week with the British and Irish Lions centre likely to sign a dual contract in Wales. 'Hopefully it will be sorted this week.

That's not the case today. Incredibly, the last four mangers to have won the Premier League have all left their jobs by the following year ‚ three sacked and one retired. And on the latest evidence, it will be no surprise if Manuel Pellegrini becomes number five this summer. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini following Manchester City's 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday night . Pellegrini guided City to their second Premier League title in three seasons back in May . But Pellegrini's City side were humbled at Selhurst Park on Monday to kill off any remaining title hopes . City sit fourth after the defeat, nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea, who retain a game in hand . WIN THE LEAGUE..AND THEN OUT . JOSE MOURINHO (CHELSEA) Won Premier League in 2006; sacked 2007 . Jose Mourinho ended Chelsea's 50-year wait to be champions by winning the Premier League in his first season 2004/05, and then retained the trophy the following season. But as his reputation soared, his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich soured and he left in September 2007 despite having three years left on his contract. Despite domestic success, Abramovich craved the Champions League and had become frustrated with the team's defensive style. For his part, Mourinho felt belittled by having players signed on Abramovich's say-so, most notably Andriy Shevchenko who was a declining force. Mourinho celebrates winning back-to-back Premier League titles with Chelsea in 2006 . Mourinho departed Stamford Bridge the following year, despite having three years left on his contract . CARLO ANCELOTTI (CHELSEA) Won PL in 2010; sacked 2011 . Carlo Ancelotti led Chelsea to their first league and FA Cup Double in his first season, scoring a record number of goals that still stands today. However, he failed to win a trophy in his second season and that was enough for Abramovich to pull the trigger despite finishing second in the table. Ancelotti knew the game was up as he puffed on a cigarette and chatted to David Moyes after Chelsea had lost the final game of the season 1-0 at Everton. The Italian bounced back to win the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and will be among the contenders for the City job should Pellegrini leave. Carlo Ancelotti celebrates with the Premier League trophy after Chelsea secured the title in 2010 . Ancelotti departed Stamford Bridge a year later after failing to win silverware in his second season . ROBERTO MANCINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2012; sacked 2013 . Mancini ended City's 44-year wait for the league title when Sergio Aguero scored against QPR on the final minute of the final day of the season. Yet his controversial approach led to him falling out with Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli, and criticising Adam Johnson and Joe Hart, and when City failed to win a trophy the following season and failed in the Champions League, the Italian was out. His demise was widely reported on the morning of the FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic. City fans chanted Mancini's name but they lost the final and he was dismissed the following week. Roberto Mancini celebrates with the Premier League trophy as Man City win the league in 2012 . Mancini waves goodbye after being sacked by Manchester City 12 months after the title win . SIR ALEX FERGUSON (MANCHESTER UNITED) Won PL in 2013; retired in 2013 . The only one of the managers who left on his own terms. Ferguson won a record 13th title and walked away into the sunset after the final game of the season, a remarkable 5-5 draw at West Brom. The United boss said later he had wanted to retire the previous season but City's title win persuaded him to carry on for another year and wrestle the trophy back ‚ which he did. Ferguson helped pick David Moyes as his successor but he grew disillusioned with his fellow Scot after Moyes got rid of his assistant Mike Phelan and built a team around Wayne Rooney. Sir Alex Ferguson led Manchester United to their 13th Premier League title in 2013 before retiring . Ferguson salutes the fans after his final game in charge at United - a 5-5 draw with West Brom in 2013 . MANUEL PELLEGRINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2014, ??? The Chilean followed Mourinho and Ancelotti in winning the Premier League in his first season and also lifted the Capital One Cup as Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure in particular shone.

At a private meeting with donors Graham alleged that plastic surgery was masking the House Minority leader's 'disgust' at the Israel leader's words. Rep. Xavier Becerra, left, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, center, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, right, listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address to a joint meeting of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. They appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran . Later that afternoon Graham, pictured here on the floor of the House before Netanyahu's speech, made fun of Pelosi during a conversation with a donor, saying, 'Did you see Nancy Pelosi on the floor. Complete disgust. If you can get through all the surgeries, there's disgust' During the joint address Pelosi and other members of Democratic leadership appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran and to put crippling sanctions on the country. Afterward, Pelosi said in a statement she 'was near tears throughout' Netanyahu's speech because she was 'saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States' and 'by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.' Later that afternoon Graham made fun of the California Democrat during a conversation with a donor, according to Bloomberg, saying, 'Did you see Nancy Pelosi on the floor. Complete disgust.' 'If you can get through all the surgeries, there's disgust,' he remarked. Upon learning of Graham's comment, several of his Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate demanded that he retract the statement. If reports are 'accurate,' fellow South Carolinian James Clyburn said on Twitter, 'he owes her an apology.' 'What's disgusting are the horrific comments you made about the first woman Speaker of the House,' Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a close friend of Pelosi's, tweeted at Graham. Graham told NBC on Tuesday evening that while he found Pelosi's claim that she was near tears 'a bit disturbing' he shouldn't have insulted her appearance. 'I made a poor attempt at humor to talk about her reaction and for that I apologize,' he said. '[Netanyahu] is not the problem in the mid-east, it's the Iranians, and anyone who wants to focus on the Prime Minister of Israel I think has got their priorities wrong,' he added. Graham is a fierce opponent of the Obama administration's approach to foreign relations in the Middle East.

One of their fellow missile officers who was a target of the same investigation pleaded guilty to illegal drug use in January and was kicked out of the service, the Air Force said on Friday. 1st Lt Michael Alonso and 1st Lt Lantz Balthazar of Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana have been charged . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at the base . Alonso and Balthazar are both members of the 12th Missile Squadron at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Malmstrom missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Launch officers are trained to operate ICBMs that are armed with nuclear warheads and are on constant alert for possible launch. Alonso was charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and for 'conspiracy related to the drug offenses', according to Malmstrom spokesman Josh Aycock. Balthazar was charged with illegal possession, use and distribution of ecstasy and cocaine and for conspiracy related to the drug offenses. He also was charged with illegal use of Pentedrone, which Aycock said is commonly called bath salts. Both officers were charged April 17. Malmstrom's missile wing operates 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles . Aycock said their cases will be reviewed at Article 32 hearings, which are akin to a civilian grand jury proceeding, to determine whether there is enough criminal evidence to warrant a court-martial. The hearings have not been scheduled, Aycock said. Alonso and Balthazar were among three Minuteman 3 launch officers at Malmstrom who were under investigation for illegal drug use. The other, 2nd Lt Nicole Dalmazzi, was charged in December and court-martialed in January. Dalmazzi, a member of the same squadron, pleaded guilty to illegal use of ecstasy and was dismissed from the Air Force and sentenced to a month of confinement in a Montana jail. The Air Force had also charged her with obstructing the Air Force Office of Special Investigations probe by allegedly dyeing her hair to alter the results of hair-follicle drug tests, but that charge was later dropped. The cases at Malmstrom stem from a drug investigation that began in August 2013 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. When investigators examined the cellphones of two airmen at Edwards they found text messages to or from 11 other Air Force officers at several other air bases, including Malmstrom. The messages allegedly detailed specific illegal drug use and led to the discovery that some had also improperly exchanged answers to ICBM launch officer proficiency tests. The ICBM force, which also operates from bases in Wyoming and North Dakota, has been under the public spotlight in recent years for a series of embarrassing missteps related to low morale, disciplinary problems, a lack of resources, training lapses and leadership failures. Last November, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans for top-to-bottom changes in management of nuclear forces and said the Pentagon would spend $8billion to fix it. In testimony to a Senate panel this week, an administration official who headed a detailed review of the nuclear forces for Hagel last year said her group believed that as much as $25billion could be needed to fix an array of problems. 'The problems that we found were worse and they were much more systemic' than expected, Madelyn Creedon said in her testimony Wednesday. Creedon, who was head of the Pentagon's nuclear policy shop at the time and is now principal deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said her review found morale in the nuclear Air Force was 'not good.' Nuclear missile crews told her they 'felt trapped' in their job. 'They would say, 'Well, I have the nuclear stink on me so I don't have much of a future in the rest of the Air Force,'' she said. The Air Force says it has begun to change that attitude by implementing a range of changes and improvements that are being felt across the force. Launch officers are trained to operate missiles armed with nuclear warheads and are on constant alert .",134,39,"air, plane, aircraft, flight, flying, pilot, fly, jet, crew, landing,","war, military, defence, army, iraq, soldiers, troops, forces, battle, iraqi,","flying the plane, the pilot of this aircraft, passengers flying for leisure or work, landing strip, the flight crew, take-offs and landings, aircraft landing, jet flying by","military forces, military troops, the battleground, defence army, ongoing war","This topic is about flying the plane, the pilot of the aircraft, passengers flying for leisure or work, landing strip, the flight crew, take-offs and landings, aircraft landing, and a jet flying by.",This topic is about military forces and troops in an ongoing war making up the defensive army.,"The aircraft was flying in a northern direction.

An ex-boyfriend flew into a furious rage and attacked his former partner in the middle of a courtroom. Lee Keeley grabbed the unnamed woman and hit her head against a wall before stamping on her head and chest at Lincoln County Court, after a judge ruled against him in a civil matter. The 38-year-old defendant chased her round the courtroom and tore out clumps of her hair after losing his temper in January. A court heard Keeley launched a chair at his ex-girlfriend before he started attacking her and barristers had to step in to break the pair up. The victim suffered a cut to her right ear, bruising and swelling to the ear, a grazed cheek as well as bruised ribs. Last Thursday, Keeley appeared before another judge at Lincoln Crown Court and admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was jailed for two years and given an indefinite restraining order, preventing him from contacting his former partner. Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: 'I understand your disappointment but your behaviour after the decision was outrageous.' A court heard Keeley, from Lincoln, had become increasingly agitated during the hearing and then erupted as Judge Richard Toombs announced the decision.

Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called for the creation of an EU army in the wake of rising tensions with Russia. The European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend the continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression. He said: 'You would not create a European army to use it immediately. 'But a common army among the Europeans would convey to Russia that we are serious about defending the values of the European Union.' He said a joint EU force would be more economical than each country individually ordering their own military kit. It would also drive further integration of the bloc's 28 member states. 'Such an army would help us design a common foreign and security policy,' the former Luxembourg prime minister said. He insisted the army would not challenge NATO's role defending Europe from Russian aggression. Mr Juncker, speaking to the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, said: 'Europe's image has suffered dramatically and also in terms of foreign policy, we don't seem to be taken entirely seriously.' The proposal is likely to infuriate Conservative backbenchers but has been welcomed in Germany. Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that 'our future as Europeans will one day be a European army' although she added 'not in the short term'. She said such a move would 'strengthen Europe's security' and 'strengthen a European pillar in the transatlantic alliance'. But Ukip's defence spokesman Mike Hookem said a European army would be 'a tragedy for the UK'. He said: 'We have all seen the utter mess the EU has made of the eurozone economy, so how can we even think of trusting them with this island's defence? 'This is simply a disaster in the making that would see Gibraltar returned to Spain and the Falkland Islands left open to an unopposed invasion by Argentina. 'Even more concerning would be the prospect of British troops under European command operating in the eastern Ukraine.' European Commission President said an EU military force would help defend continent from Vladimir Putin's aggression . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years . It comes amid warnings that relations between Russia and the EU are likely to be 'prickly' for many years. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that significant further sanctions could be imposed by the EU unless Moscow abided by the terms of the Ukraine ceasefire. He said under Mr Putin Russia had moved from being a partner of the West to seeing Europe as an 'adversary'. Mr Putin's view of Russia's influence over former Soviet states 'puts him at odds' with the West, Mr Hammond said. Newly mobilized Ukrainian paratroopers wait to board a helicopter as tensions rise with Russia . On BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond warned that further aggression by Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine would trigger an escalation in the sanctions regime. 'We have all made clear that if there is a big assault, for example on Mariupol, that will be responded to with a significant increase in the economic pressure on Russia from the EU,' he said. Asked if that could trigger a new Cold War he said: 'I don't want to talk about cold wars, but we are clear that Russia has decided, it has made the decision that it wants to be in a strategic competition with the West, with Europe. 'It doesn't any longer see us as partners, it sees us as competitors or even adversaries and that means that we are going to have a difficult, prickly relationship with Russia probably for some time to come.' 'We don't think there can be a military resolution to this crisis. The disparity between the size of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Russian armed forces doesn't make that a sensible way to go. 'We have to insist that the rules-based system which says very clearly that you can't change international boundaries by force, is protected.' Although Mr Hammond said it was clear that 'we are not going to fight the Russians in Ukraine', the UK was providing support to Kiev. 'We are providing training, we are providing technical support, we provide them with non-lethal equipment,' he said. 'We have said that we will keep this under review.' He said that under the peace plan agreed in Minsk, Moscow has committed to handing back control of all of Ukraine's territory, including the border with Russia, by the end of this year. 'We have to hold them to that. If that doesn't happen Russia can expect the temperature to be turned up significantly,' he said. A machine gun sits inside a pro-Russian rebel trench along the front lines two kilometers from Ukrainian troops . He stressed that there was a 'hard red line' protecting Nato's Baltic members from Russian incursions, with the option of invoking the alliance's measure allowing for collective defence: 'Mr Putin knows that very well and that is what protects the Baltic states.' Mr Hammond claimed the Russian president believed he had 'some kind of strategic veto' over the freedom of action of former Soviet states. 'That puts him, frankly, at odds with our view of the post-Soviet settlement in Europe,' the Foreign Secretary said. Pressed on the Nato 2% spending target, Mr Hammond said: 'I can't tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto, but you will find out soon enough, and I can't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election.

Kraft, answering questions from a prosecutor and one of Hernandez's attorneys on the witness stand in a Massachusetts courtroom, recalled a private conversation that he had with the star Patriots tight end on June 19, at the Patriots' Gillette Stadium, as news spread that Hernandez was being investigated in Lloyd's death. ""He said he was not involved,"" Kraft testified in the courtroom in Fall River. ""He said he was innocent."" Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semipro football player who was found dead in Massachusetts on June 17, 2013. Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Kraft testified that he asked to speak with Hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium, and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in Lloyd's death. According to Kraft, Hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of Lloyd's death ""came out,"" because Hernandez had been at a club that night. According to testimony from Hernandez's fiance, Shayanna Jenkins, the player had not been at a club, but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting. Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst, called Kraft's testimony ""explosive."" ""What a great, great witness for the prosecution,"" she said. ""Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand."" How did Hernandez know when the murder happened, Robbins asked, unless he was there? The Patriots' owner also testified, when asked by a defense attorney, that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez, and that the player was always respectful to him. The billionaire magnate of The Kraft Group, a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment, said Hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss. Asked by the defense why Hernandez was signed to a $40 million long-term contract, Kraft said simply: ""He's a very good player."" At times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand, Kraft seemed uncomfortable. ""Do you work?"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked Kraft. ""I think so, yes."" Asked where he worked, Kraft responded, 1 Patriot Place, or Gillette Stadium, where the Super Bowl champions play their home games. ""What do you do for work?"" ""Whatever they ask me to do."" Outside court, surrounded by cameras, Kraft expressed sadness over Lloyd's death. ""A man died,"" he said. ""This is about a man being killed. It's unfortunate."" Later, Mark Briggs, head of security at Gillette Stadium, testified that he also asked Hernandez whether the former star was telling the truth about Lloyd. ""He swore on the baby's life that he was telling the truth,"" Briggs said. Hernandez was arrested in connection with Lloyd's death a week after that meeting with Kraft. The Patriots released Hernandez less than two hours after the arrest on June 26, 2013. Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a young daughter.

The bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor in Turkey's Super Lig. Fener said on their official website the bus driver was wounded in the attack and taken to hospital and there was no mention of any injuries to anyone else. Marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack . The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night . The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help after the attack . A statement on the club's official website on Sunday said: 'We consider that as long as this attack is not solved in a way that satisfies Fenerbahce and public opinion, a suspension of the championship is inevitable. 'Blood ran and football was silenced. Finding and punishing the culprits is of vital importance for Fenerbahce.' Following the incident, Fener midfielder Mehmet Topal told Sky News: 'We cheated death. God protect us. I hope our driver will be all right. Words fail me. It's unbelievable.' The club posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen.

Local TV footage reportedly showed the damage to the team bus and a hole in the steering wheel . The pictures also showed blood on the driver's seat and the steering wheel. The attack followed Fener's 5-1 win away to Rizespor. The bus was going over a viaduct on its way from the city of Rize to the airport in Trabzon to return to Istanbul. Fener general secretary Mahmut Uslu said on the club website the attack was 'very wrong', saying: 'We came here to play sport, we came to play football.'

For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season . This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event. If Palmer can continue to push, or even on occasion better the times of Maldonado and team-mate Romain Grosjean, doors may open. 'I want to be really pushing the race drivers. That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.' Unfortunately for last year's GP2 champion, his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with Lotus may prove a hindrance. Palmer drives during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend . The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere.

The ex-Rangers youth has been mourning the loss of Shaun Cole, 22, who was found dead in a Miami street last weekend and is thought to have been the victim of a hit-and-run driver. A soldier who had served in Afghanistan, he was on holiday in Florida while on leave and had attended a music festival there before being found on a pavement with a head injury which proved fatal. Livingston boss Mark Burchill is hopeful that midfielder Darren Cole will turn out for his side on Sunday . Livingston star Cole, 23, was close to Shaun and paid tribute to the army private on his Twitter account this week. He wrote: 'I know you won't be here for the rest of our lives but I can promise I'll love you for the rest of mine.' Cole was granted time off by the Championship side as they prepare to face Alloa at McDiarmid Park in their first national final in 11 years. But he returned to training on Wednesday and is due to work with the players again after a squad day off on Thursday. Burchill is not putting any pressure on the 23-year-old to play despite the fact he has been a key member of the team since signing a short-term deal in February. He will give Cole as much time as he needs to grieve and accept whatever decision he makes - but admits that the former Murray Park youngster has given the impression he would like to be involved. Burchill said: 'Darren was away from the club initially and we don't really know what to expect but I am speaking with him constantly to plan with him. 'He came back to training on Wednesday but is still in a bit of shock after what has happened, which is completely understandable. 'If I'm honest, I really don't know if he is going to play so we will need to see how things go once we get towards Saturday and Sunday. 'I think Darren would like to play but he has never been through something like this before in his life. 'Him and Shaun were much closer than a lot of cousins are.

567,3OF2M9AATIQ4ZVA8VMB4530XREGZK7,3a9e3538bf79aaa0faf4080e3e6a9b549cdbb0c3,"A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. Spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration. Until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast Spain. But then the climate warmed to 13∞C (55∞F) and became more humid. This enabled hominins (stock image shown) - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions . The research was led by Dr Jordi Agusti from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). Published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the paper suggests climate change affected the amount of resources available. There have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors, but a study from Oxford University published last year claimed to have finally settled the debate. An ancient human ancestor known as 'Nutcracker Man' lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts, worms and grasshoppers, according to research. Scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative, called Paranthropus boisei, which lived in East Africa between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago, had such distinctively powerful jaws and large, flat molar teeth. The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco Le≥n site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago, reported Popular Archaeology. But they were not able to migrate to this region until conditions improved. The researchers said that the early Pleistocene era (the era lasted from 2.59 million to 11,700 years ago) was characterised by colder and drier weather. This 'possibly impeded the settlement of this region by the early hominin population from the southern Caucasus,' the researchers wrote. But shortly afterwards, 'when the climatic conditions were again favourable, a hominin presence is suddenly evidenced.' The theory is based on analysis of the Barranco Le≥n site in the Guadix-Baza Basin in southeast Spain, shown by the grey marker on this map. Here, simple Oldowan tools have previously been found, linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago . The Acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive Oldowan period. Tools at the time included large stone hand axes (stock image shown) made from flint and quartzite, used to scavenge from carcasses . It should be noted that the warming climate referred to here is on a vastly longer time scale than modern climate change. At the time 1.4 million years ago, though, temperatures warmed above 13∞C (55∞F) and humidity increased, allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools. 'The data reported here clearly support the idea that the early hominin occupation of Europe was strongly constrained by climatic and environmental conditions, rather than by physiography or cultural factors,' the researchers wrote.",100,198,"earth, sun, climate, planet, change, surface, atmosphere, carbon, global, temperature,","study, researchers, google, scientists, university, data, journal, human, humans, dna,","global climate change, atmosphere around the Earth, carbon emissions affect climate change, Earth's surface, global temperatures, temperature of the sun","study by researchers, university researchers, scientific journals, scientists at Google, studying humans, the data showed","This topic is about how carbon emissions affect global climate change, the Earth‚Äôs surface as well as the atmosphere around the Earth, the temperature of the sun, and global temperatures.","This topic is about university researchers, scientific journals, studying humans, and studies by researchers.","Climate change has been a part of Earth's history for millions of years, even affecting early humans.

Evidence from related ancestors have found changes in their physiology in order to survive on specific diets.

A carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90-year-old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her PIN written in her diary. Vicky Marks left her frail victim Joan Groucher 'heartbroken' by abusing her trust to plunder £4,200 from her bank account over a seven-month period. The victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in Croydon, south London and move into sheltered accommodation. Marks, 59, visited Mrs Groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash, using the code written in the elderly woman's diary. She even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital, Croydon Crown Court heard. Sentencing Marks to 12 months in jail, Recorder Silas Reid told her: 'The victim was in her nineties, had problems with dementia, and, effectively, you inveigled your way into her family.' He added: 'It's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age, why you would cause her that much pain, which, in the end, wasn't really for that much money. 'But time and time again you took her card and took money from her account. It seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money.' Mrs Groucher, who has four children and eight grand-children, had lived at the same house for around 30 years, but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care. 'One of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home,' Mr Reid said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Groucher said: 'I know Vicky does not have a mother, but that is no reason to do what she did. 'You were trusted by me and I'm heartbroken. It's disgusting what Vicky did to me. It worries me she could have done it to other people.' Paul Fairley, prosecuting, told the court that Mrs Groucher paid Marks £10 every time she visited. The thief's deception was found out when Mrs Groucher's daughter Caroline Baldwin, 70, saw that there was money missing from her bank account in July last year. Hearing: Croydon Crown Court (above) heard Marks even stole money while Mrs Groucher was ill in hospital . 'She noticed there was £2,000, or £3,000 less than what there should have been,' Mr Fairley said. Mrs Baldwin then took a closer look at her mother's bank statement and noticed 'a pattern of sums of £100 and £200 withdrawn over a significant period of time', he added. She notified the police who checked CCTV footage from the Lloyd's Bank branch in Croydon and identified Marks withdrawing £100 from the victim's account the previous day. Marks, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing. Speaking outside court today, Mrs Baldwin said her family was 'elated' by the jail sentence, but added: 'It's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly. 'Part of that is due to her age, but every time I see her she mentions it and says, ""Why did she take it?"" and ""How could she do that?"" 'When I told her about the sentence it was the first time I have seen her smile for a long time.' Mrs Baldwin said she was 'disgusted' by Marks, whom her family had known for around five years, saying: 'If she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow. 'I think she has gotten away with it up until now, but we weren't going to let her get away with it.'",195,128,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","money, pay, paid, card, credit, paying, cards, spent, fund, amount,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","paid money using a credit card, spent money, amount of credit, received funds","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about credit, receiving funds, paying money using a credit card, and spending money.","This was a fairly straightforward criminal case of theft of a caregiver named Vicky Marks. She would go on to steal money for the elderly Joan Groucher who, because of her advanced years, was very much unaware of Mark's access to her finances and bank card. Marks was eventually found out by Mrs. Groucher's children and was then tried and convicted in court, rightfully so. Her family and in particular, Mrs. Groucher were both hurt and disturbed by her crime and deceit. It had a psychological impact on Mrs. Groucher due to her advanced years. They were very happy when she was sentenced.","Vicky marks repeatedly used her access to Mrs. Groucher's finances abusively and made many transactions and withdrawals of her funds at ATM's.

570,3SBEHTYCWP5DOAAFZXO9EGCITJMIYT,1e91aab995a9f6dd21515d0393479d0bc69a6669,"Hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease. The scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the 'pulse of the planet' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on Earth. The technique is normally used by surgeons to detect irregular heartbeats in large amounts of data from echocardiograms. The graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of Central European air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. The black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014 . Researchers at the University of Leicester, however, have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in Europe. They found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times-scales of longer than 12 months. The chances of heatwaves in Europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures, experts have said. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade, a study from the Met Office found last year. The chances of extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across Europe, have also increased tenfold, from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century. By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, according to the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year. It found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. Despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s, the new study found summer temperatures in central and Mediterranean Europe affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by 0.81∞C (1.4∞F) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013. They say this may be a sign that the regional temperatures are being influenced by more complex feedback systems and may explain why extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and cold spells are happening more irregularly. Professor Heiko Balzter, a climate scientist at the University of Leicester who led the study, said: 'I had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data. 'It has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease, because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time-series data. 'We are literally taking the pulse of the planet. 'Interestingly, the changes we found only operated on time-scales longer than about a year. 'On these time-scales the climate seems to have become less predictable.' Multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly. It many of these chunks are found then the data has low entropy and high regularity. If few are found then the system is harder to predict. The research team, shoe work is published in the journal Climate, used this approach to analyse the Central European variance-adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies. They found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months. Professor Balzter said: 'Evidence is mounting that the temporal dynamics of the climate system are changing at the same time as the average global temperature is increasing due to multiple climate forcings. Heatwaves, like the one above hitting Brighton Beach, have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across Europe have become more irregular, according to the new research by climate scientists . This map of central Europe shows where entropy has increased (blue) and where it has decreased (red) This map of central Europe shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy, as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero . 'A large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells, heatwaves, droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years.

John and Carolyn Jackson also forced some of the children to drink hot sauce or eat hot pepper flakes and weren't exposed until one of their biological children reported the abuse to someone outside the family, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Shumofsky said in his opening statement. That child, now in his teens, is expected to provide key testimony for the prosecution. The trial marks the second go-round for the Jacksons, whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died. Cruel: Army Major John Jackson (left) and his wife Carolyn (right) are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children. Pictured above in May 2013 . The judge had previously ruled that the boy's death could not be introduced during the trial since the defendants were not charged directly with his death. Second trial: The Jacksons first child abuse trial was ruled a mistrial when a prosecutor mentioned the death of one of their sons - a detail that was not supposed to be mentioned in the proceedings. The Jacksons had three biological children and three adopted children. They have only been charged for abusing the foster children . The Jacksons, who live in Mount Holly, were stationed at Picatinny Arsenal, a military installation about 40 miles west of New York City, when the abuse occurred between 2005 and 2010, according to a 15-count superseding indictment. They had three biological children who showed no signs of abuse, Shumofsky said. But they disciplined their three foster children by withholding food and water as punishment and by hitting them with different objects, he added. The treatment left them with bruises and injuries including, for one child, a skull fracture and spinal fracture, and for another, a broken arm. The children were well under normal weight when they were removed from the Jackson home, Shumofsky said, including one who weighed less at nearly three years old than he did when he joined the family at 11 months old. One of the girls had scars, marks and infections and had a dangerously high level of salt in her body that doctors said they'd never seen before in a two-year-old, Shumofsky told jurors. Attorneys representing the Jacksons conceded that though the Jacksons' child-rearing methods may be objectionable to some, they didn't rise to the level of criminality. 'You might think, `I would never raise a hand to my child,'' said attorney Rubin Sinins, representing Carolyn Jackson. 'But that doesn't make it criminal. Because what Carolyn Jackson was doing was acting in good faith in her role as parent.' Jackson would have had to have known that her actions would cause harm to be considered guilty, he added. 'If you're a crappy parent, you're not a criminal,' he said. Countering photos shown by Shumofsky that showed the children with visible marks and scars, Sinins showed jurors pictures of the two girls smiling with their parents or friends in pictures taken weeks earlier. Sinins and David Holman, representing John Jackson, both mentioned in their opening statements that while the government's experts concluded abuse had taken place though they hadn't treated the children, the children's treating doctors did not reach that conclusion.",195,200,"court, trial, guilty, prison, heard, case, jury, murder, judge, sentence,","children, child, parents, birth, born, kids, families, mother, family, care,","found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, could face jail time, received a fine and a suspended prison sentence","children and parents, families with children, having kids, giving birth, she became a mother, baby was born","This topic is about a person found guilty in the trial before a judicial panel, opening a criminal trial against him, a person potentially facing jail time,  receiving a fine, and a suspended prison sentence.","This topic is about having kids, becoming a mother, giving birth, children and their parents, and families with children when a baby is born.","Foster Parents John and Carolyn Jackson are facing a child abuse trial for abuse and neglect of their foster children that had went on for years.

To understand this crisis, let's compare two countries. Country A is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion, government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate. It allows workers to retire in their 50s, and pays double pensions when they do. It lied about its budget to get into the eurozone. Country B is a large, historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt. Country B even ran budget surpluses, including a 2% surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008. It entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances. If you guessed that country A is Greece, you are correct. If you believe Greece has caused the crisis in Europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility, then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter. But what do we make of fiscally responsible country B? Its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis. And it must be Germany, right? Wrong. Country B is not Germany. Country B is Spain. Far from prospering, Spain is doing terribly. Spain's unemployment rate is 23.7%, down from a high of almost 27% in 2013. More than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years. More than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years. There is regularly talk of a lost generation in Spain and Greece. Like Greece, Spain's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout (although a much smaller one) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing. Spain's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to GDP ratio has shot up dramatically. If Greece and Spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence, what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in? The answer is not fiscal virtue. Something else is going on. That something else, in large part, is the euro. Joining the eurozone meant Spain and Greece gave up the power to create money, the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness, and the power to set interest rates. These are not trivial concessions, especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited, strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis, and trade between euro-area nations is severely imbalanced. The inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s, Spain and Greece couldn't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies. The over-heating was largely caused, by the way, by the frenzied (and ultimately reckless) lending in both countries by German and other core European banks. The European Central Bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in Germany and France that proved too low for Spain and Greece (and Ireland). Read: 25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis . The over-heating of the Greek and Spanish economies led to inflation and investment bubbles. As those bubbles burst, the banks neared collapse, and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis. The inability of Spain and Greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in Europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the EU. Strict budget rules of Eurozone membership also required Spain and Greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. They were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels. Austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in Greece and a severe recession in Spain. The policies also created runaway public debt. Greece's debt is now 175% of GDP. Spain's debt to GDP ratio is 100% -- a level not seen in Spain in more than 100 years. Because Spain and Greece cannot devalue the euro, the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation. This means Greece and Spain are in for years of high unemployment, reduced living standards, falling wages and deflation. In other words, massive impoverization. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, famously said: ""The euro is forever."" That may or may not be so, but it doesn't mean that countries like Greece and Spain should stay in the euro forever. Contrary to popular opinion, this crisis cannot be explained away with a moral tale of Greek fiscal irresponsibility.

Elizabeth Warren last week offered a defiant response: ""Bring it on."" Warren said she isn't going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in Wall Street. As Hillary Clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month, she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, is trying to steal Clinton's thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth. In other words, there are many signs that Democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality. But in other recent news, the likelihood that New York's Chuck Schumer will replace Harry Reid as leader of the Senate Democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality. While Schumer has been a very effective Democrat and skilled legislative leader, he is also a Wall Street Democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state. He is not alone. Even at his most progressive moments, President Barack Obama relied on Wall Street donations for both of his campaigns. Despite all the talk from conservatives about left-wing ""socialism"" in the White House, the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to Democrats without much concern, even in the 2012 election. Democratic populism can't really work within the current campaign finance system. The enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on Democrats, despite their political base, to court big donors. During the 1980s, California Democrat Tony Coelho, serving as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and then as majority whip, made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to Republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money. The Democrats were, and have continued to, losing their traditional base of campaign support --organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s, providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns. Without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing, many Democrats concluded they needed business by their side. Democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices. In 2008, Obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the post-Watergate public finance system for campaigns altogether, preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign. While small donors were enormously important to his victories, so too were business and Wall Street executives. At the height of the financial crash, when public sentiment had clearly turned against Wall Street, the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill (Dodd-Frank) that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years. Wall Street, with an army of counsel, succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation. Not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices Democrats can make, but it also greatly damages the party's brand name. As The Washington Post reported, the scandal that might bring down New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez is the first involving large scale super PAC donations. At the heart of the story is almost $600,000 that physician Salomon Melgen gave to Senate Majority PAC, possibly in exchange for favors. This is not simply some sort of accommodation of Democrats to the corporate system. They don't have much of a choice. Without these funds, they won't be able to compete. In this election cycle, independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir. In conservative circles, the Koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda. Individual donors such as Las Vegas gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak, pressuring them to adjust their agenda. Democrats have found their own magnates for political support, such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. This is why campaign finance reform is so important, Without Congress changing the fundamental dynamics, there won't be much room for populism to thrive. Even if Democrats select someone like a Elizabeth Warren as their candidate or Hillary Clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy, there won't be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts. The Democratic Party needs Wall Street more than it needs to take a stand against Wall Street. Those are the facts on the ground. If Democrats really want to take on Wall Street and tackle economic inequality, they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system. If campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures, Wall Street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence. Reform could level the playing field. More often than not, campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support. A more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system. If things stay the same, Democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support.",113,175,"campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","house, committee, congress, senate, republican, republicans, senator, rep, federal, democrats,","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","senate and congress, congressional pressure, you can call your representative's office, told a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, staffer to the Democratic senator, federal employee benefits","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","This topic is about the senate and congress, congressional pressure, calling one's representative's office, informing a Senate committee, lawmakers setting the record straight, the staffer to the Democratic senator, and federal employee benefits.",Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley challenged Hillary Clinton on campaign financing.

Emwazi, who is originally from London, was planning on joining al-Shabaab in Africa but changed his mind after his friends were killed amid accusations they were set up by rival group members. Instead he travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State and became synonymous with their gruesome beheading videos posted online. Scroll for video . Mohammed Emwazi (left), now known as masked killer Jihadi John (right), planned to join al-Shabaab in Somalia before going to Syria because two of his friends were killed, a source has said . According to a 29-year-old Syrian, named only as Ayman, Emwazi was obsessed with al-Shabaab and constantly spoke about the fighting in Somalia. In an interview with The Independent, Ayman says Emwazi once confided in him that he planned to join al-Shabaab before coming to Syria because Somalia was too dangerous. Ayman, who said he met Emwazi in Syria after ISIS captured his hometown, added: 'Mohammed was obsessed with al-Shabaab, he was angry about what happened in Africa. 'Some of his friends had been killed, some sent to prison and he thought they had been betrayed.' Emwazi became convinced al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies after friends Bilal al-Berjawi (pictured) and Mohammed Sakr were killed . The friends referred to are likely to be Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohammed Sakr, two members of the 'London Boys' gang of extremists that grew up with Emwazi in Maida Vale, north west London. Al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells, and helped to radicalise Emwazi while in the UK. Three years ago he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia, and according to Ayman, Emwazi was convinced that his location had been given to the Americans by fellow members of al-Shabaab during an internal power struggle. Emwazi also believed that another friend, Mohammed Sakr, who at one time had lived next door to al-Berjawi, was also betrayed to his death after he was killed in February 2012, also in Somalia. Emwazi has previously been accused of trying to join al-Shabaab, and was detained in August 2009 after flying to Tanzania in east Africa with a group of friends. They had claimed to be going on a wildlife safari, but were sent back to the Netherlands by security forced, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent who tried to recruit him. Al-Berjawi and Sakr were also detained in Kenya around the same time, but later returned to Africa and were able to make it to Somalia, where they joined the fighting. Ayman claims that Emwazi also intended to return, but after his friends were killed he decided against it, believing al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies and was too dangerous. He added: 'Perhaps the British should be sorry they did not let him go to Somalia, he would probably be dead now like his friends.' In 2012, Emwazi fled Britain for Syria, despite being on terror watchlists, where he eventually joined the ranks of ISIS. Emwazi was accused of trying to join al-Shabaab in 2009 when he flew to Tanzania before being sent back home by security force. He joined ISIS in Syria in 2012 (pictured, al-Shabaab militants in Somalia) It is thought that during the early stages of the conflict Emwazi was a prison guard, along with three other Britons, leading to them being nicknamed The Beatles. Escaped captives had given him the name John, after Beatles lyricist John Lennon, which eventually became Jihadi John. In previous interviews, French hostages have described how Emwazi talked to them about al-Shabaab and the war in Somalia, making them watch videos of the fighting there. Emwazi first rose to international attention in August 2014 when he appeared in a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Since then he has been seen in videos showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, Peter Kassig, a former U.S. solider. Also murdered at the hands of Emwazi were David Haines and Alan Henning, two British aid workers, and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yakuwa.",64,115,"group, forces, fighters, killed, fighting, militants, syrian, border, town, city,","family, wife, daughter, husband, couple, pictured, friends, left, brother, friend,","group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, border town","family and friends, husband and wife, the couple's daughter, the two brothers","This topic is about a group composed of militants, fighters joining forces, ongoing violence in the capital, people dead across the country, militants armed with grenades, and a border town.","This topic is about family and friends, and a husband and wife, the couple‚Äôs daughter has two brothers.",Muhammad was obsessed with violence that was in his life.

577,3BDCF01OGZWFEBILK0LM6W4AAG1YLU,ad0aafb71bbeb906dba9cda85bb350eecc0e960f,"(CNN)A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. ""Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,"" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease.

The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.",236,194,"film, movie, character, films, viewers, set, characters, bond, series, box,","russian, russia, european, europe, ukraine, putin, moscow, greece, eastern, euro,","movie characters, the new series, action films, bond between the characters, viewers of the film","Ukraine and Russia, called to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathered in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, bloc of nations within the European Union","This topic is about a new series based off action films, for which viewers of the film watch for the bonds between the characters.","This topic is about Ukraine and Russia, calling to fight for Ukraine, euro countries, Russian officials gathering in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a citizen of the eastern European country, and a bloc of nations within the European Union.",In an uncommon move russia has dropped the arrival of a hollywood spine chiller set in the stalin period asserting it contorts histore and would air as the nation praises its triumph over nazi germany.

Any clash against Manchester United, particularly in the Wenger era, carries added value for the Gunners. The fact that it is an FA Cup quarter-final with a place at Wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion. And for Wenger it's a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on Louis van Gaal's side ahead of the tense season finale. Theo Walcott holds off Nacho Monreal as Arsenal trained on Sunday at their London Colney training ground . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lets fly with a shot, as Arsene Wenger promised his team would attack United . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Arsene Wenger is confident his team can beat Manchester United by playing attacking football . The FA Cup isn't the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe. They are also battling for a Champions League position, a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs' long-term ambitions. There are no points at stake tonight but Wenger said: 'It's a big game, and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team.' However, the reverse is also true. Losing against United could plant a seed of doubt in Arsenal's quest to finish in the top four ‚î and their poor recent record at Old Trafford doesn't bode well. United have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the Gunners. We shouldn't forget, though, that Wenger also has pleasant memories of the Theatre of Dreams. He lists Sylvain Wiltord's goal that clinched the title for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 as his favourite. And the Frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in United's back yard on Monday night. Arsenal's World Cup winning playmaker Mesut Ozil has been in top form since returning from injury . Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez, who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against QPR, looks lively in training . Per Mertesacker, whose place was in doubt before an injury to Gabriel, gestures to his team-mates . 'I don't believe our recent record at Old Trafford (to be a factor). When the team is less good, they lose. When the team is not as good, they lose,' said Wenger. 'It doesn't matter what shirt they wear, or what stadium they play in. It is down to quality. 'If I've learnt something in my life it's that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day, not where you play. 'The fact that we can win away from home, that is important. If you haven't won away from home all season it's more difficult. But we know we can do well away from home.' Tomas Rosicky attempts to control the ball as Walcott, Mertesacker and Ramsey watch on . Indeed, their victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium earlier this season proved they can produce big away performances against England's elite, and Wenger insists last season's FA Cup triumph has bolstered belief that his side can become English football's top dogs once more. 'Yes, of course we want to dominate again,' said Wenger. 'I think today you have more competitors and it will get worse with the seasons coming because you get more money in. That means even the smaller teams will be capable to buy the best players in Europe. Sylvain Wiltord's goal at Old Trafford in 2002 that clinched the league title for the Gunners at Old Trafford . 'Maybe the competition will become harder for everybody. Winning the FA Cup gave us energy because we had a few years without winning a trophy and so on that front it was vital. 'This team has a good mentality because we had a slow start this season and every time we lost a big game you see how much the players are touched. 'I think the mentality is very healthy, they want to do well and we will be focused on Manchester United. 'Once you get to the quarter- final you think that's a good opportunity to win a trophy. You want to do it, but it's at that stage where it's conflicting always with the Champions League.'",152,217,"united, manchester, liverpool, chelsea, league, premier, city, manager, ferguson, striker,","club, team, season, players, england, football, player, league, fans, game,","Manchester United's manager, Premier League, the striker for the team, Liverpool versus Chelsea","football league, the team's fans, football player, this season's games, world championship, tournament","This topic is about Manchester United's manager, Premier League, the striker for the team, and Liverpool versus Chelsea.","This topic is about a football league having a world championship where each team‚Äôs fans are gathered to watch the end of this season‚Äôs games culminating in a tournament, to see their favorite football player.",The Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is confident about their match against United.

Playing at Old Trafford the home of the Manchester United can be a hard place to play in. The Arsenal record at Old Trafford is not the best but but Per Mertesacker a team member thinks otherwise that if you are not up to playing GREAT your just good and will lose.

But for Shanna McCormick, that particular concern paled into insignificance. Weighing 28st, the 31-year-old, feared she would not live to see her wedding day. For most of her adult life, Miss McCormick's obesity meant had been in and out of hospital, suffering with life-threatening asthma attacks. Doctors warned the strain of being overweight would kill her if she didn't slim down - and fast. Shanna McCormick, 31, whose weight had ballooned to nearly 28st (left) managed to lose 16.5st in two years so she can walk down the aisle with pride . Before her weight loss, Miss McCormick's partner Dan Dimmock had been terrified his partner would die in her sleep. Now, the pair are engaged to be married and have bought a house together . Determined not to be a fat wife to her boyfriend of 14 years, Dan Dimmock, Miss McCormick called off their engagement to embark on a strict two-year weight-loss plan. It was only after she managed to lose 16.5st and dropped 18 dress sizes that she decided she was ready to walk down the aisle. Miss McCormick, 31, from Manchester, said: 'I had been told for years that my life was at risk because of my weight, and so it went in one ear out the other. 'I was immune to hearing it because I'd heard it for so long, but it was different for Dan. BEFORE: . Breakfast: Nothing. Morning snack: Two bags of sweets and fizzy drink. Lunch: Fish and chips. Afternoon snack: Cans of fizzy drink with more sweets, chocolate and crisps. Dinner: Chinese takeaway plus several glasses of wine or cider, and more sweets. AFTER: . Breakfast: Flour-free pancakes with raspberries or a Cambridge shake. Morning snack: Fruit and bottle of water. Lunch: Tuna or chicken salad with water. Dinner: Omelette with green salad and water. Afternoon snack: Bag of hazelnuts with water. 'He was worried sick. Sometimes he couldn't sleep at night because he thought something would happen to me. 'He used to check to see that I was still breathing in the middle of the night. 'The truth is that, at my biggest, I didn't think I had a future. 'Doctors warned me I would die if I didn't lose weight, so what was the point in planning a wedding? 'I might not even be there to see it.' At 5ft 6ins, Miss McCormick's life was in constant danger and she admits she can't remember a time when she was not overweight. At primary school she was the biggest girl in her class and she was already obese by the time she moved to secondary school. Conditions linked to her weight, including asthma, made her a target for bullies, and she turned to food for comfort. By the time she met Dan aged 18, Miss McCormick was living on crisps, bread and pizza. She was a size 20 and weighed 22st. Though he was slim, her weight crept up to its 27.5st peak as their relationship progressed. In 2007 she spent nine days in intensive care when she suffered a severe asthma attack, which doctors blamed on her weight. Miss McCormick said doctors warnings her weight would kill her went 'in one ear out the other'. But they terrified her partner, who couldn't sleep at night worrying something might happen to her . Miss McCormick said: 'I was offered weight-loss surgery but was too scared of dying on the operating table, because my weight made the anaesthetic a risk. 'I knew something had to give but I didn't know how to make the change.' In 2010 the couple became engaged for the first time, but it soon became clear there was no way they could plan their big day with Miss McCormick's health problems. Her frequent visits to hospital meant that it would have been very difficult to set a date and stick to it. 'I wanted nothing more than to marry Dan but I couldn't stand the thought of him becoming my carer as well as my husband,' she said. 'My size was ruining everything. Now it had even ruined my engagement and stopped me marrying the man I loved.' It was seeing Mr Dimmock's fear and uncertainty about their future together that finally forced Miss McCormick into action and she vowed to stop overeating. But because of her unhealthy relationship with food and several failed attempts with conventional diets, she opted for a meal replacement plan in order to avoid even the slightest temptation. Miss McCormick said she cannot remember a time she wasn't overweight, and used to turn to food for comfort. She is pictured, left and right, before her weight loss . She signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan in August 2011, which allowed her to have four products a day, including a range of milkshakes, nutrition bars and soups. To her surprise she found it easier to stick to than the calorie controlled plans which had failed in the past. She lost 9lbs in the first week. She recalled: 'It was not easy start with and I missed food terribly, but after a few days I got into the zone and never wavered.' After losing 16.5st, Miss McCormick could look at herself in the mirror with pride . In the first year she lost an impressive 8st and saw her health improve dramatically. 'The asthma attacks become less frequent and I wasn't relying on medication all the time,' she said. She lost another 8st the following year and reached her 11st and size 12 target in March 2013. For the first time, she could look in the mirror with pride. Miss McCormick, who has maintained her target weight since, said: 'I loved being able to shop anywhere I wanted but what I really loved was seeing the peace of mind it gave Dan. 'It was worth all the hard slog. 'And looking in the mirror at the new slender me was a joy. 'I never thought that would happen.' So much so that last June, when Dan popped the question again, while the pair were sat on a Los Angeles beach, Miss McCormick did not think twice about accepting and getting on with the planning. She said: 'He went down on one knee with a gorgeous vintage platinum ring. 'I loved it but I had to have it made smaller when we got back home because I had lost even more weight.' But the biggest compliment came when a friend of the couple failed to recognise her. Miss McCormick, who is now a fully trained weight-loss consultant helping other women reach their goals, said: 'I was sitting there chatting away to him when it dawned on me that he didn't know who I was. 'When I told him it was me he just did not believe me. 'It was a huge compliment.' As well as planning their wedding in Las Vegas next year the couple have also bought their dream period home to renovate. 'It will take us years as it needs a lot of work, but it's something I can commit to now I've lost the weight,' Miss McCormick said. Mr Dimmock said he is delighted his partner was able to lose so much weight. He said: 'I used to think the radical before and-after weight-loss images in glossy magazines could never be true until I watched Shanna do it for herself.

The brother of ex-footballer Ryan Giggs has lost his job as a HGV driver after being banned from the roads for driving without insurance. Rhodri Giggs, 37, revealed that he is now unemployed as he lost his licence after being found guilty of driving a Mercedes C200 without insurance. Under the 'totting-up' procedure, the former player-manager of non-league side Salford City, was forced to hand over his licence having already accrued six points from two previous speeding offences.

After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined £110 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Full-time salaries in the capital have only risen by 6.9 per cent in six years since the recession, according to the Office for National Statistics. This means London workers have seen their salaries rise by just over 1 per cent a year since 2008 ‚ way below the rate of inflation.

Pay in the North East has risen by 13.4 per cent since 2008, 8.1 per cent in the South West, 7.5 per cent in the East and East Midlands. Despite seeing their pay squeezed more than elsewhere, salaries in the capital are still far higher than anywhere else in the country. The median full-time salary in London hit £34,069 last year ‚ up from £32,813 in 2008. In the North East, by contrast, the average worker took home £24,876 last year. The squeeze on wages in the capital has coincided with a hiring splurge and strong economic growth. Despite seeing their pay squeezed more than elsewhere, salaries in the capital are still far higher than anywhere else in the country . Wages in the North East (left) have grown almost twice as fast as those in London since the recession in 2008 . Tony Travers from the London School of Economics told the Financial Times said workers in the capital were more likely to be young, in the private sector and out of a union. He said this meat bosses found it easier to control wages while hiring more staff. Professor Travers said: 'If the story of the last five or six years has been one of flexibility in the economy, accommodating radical changes because of the recession, then you would expect that to show up in London most. 'London does have the biggest private sector economy of any region in the country, so it's likely to be the least unionised, the most flexible.' Paul Bivand, of the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion, said there had been a boom in low-paid jobs in the capital since the recession. Over the past year pay has finally started to rise above of inflation. Average earnings increased by 2.1 per cent in the year to December, 0.3 per cent up on the previous month. At the same time, inflation fell to just 0.5 per cent in December. Unemployment, meanwhile, has continued to fall down to a near seven-year low ‚ with the jobless total dipping by 97,000 in three months to December, taking the total number of people out of work to 1.86 million. This is down by almost half a million on a year ago. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance has also been cut ‚ falling by 38,600 in December to 823,000, the 27th consecutive fall and the lowest since the summer of 2008.

With a total of 1.86 people in unemployment, the UK has the third lowest unemployment rates in Europe, with Austria and Germany being ahead. This trend is further backed by the 27 consecutive fall in the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance ever since the 2008 recession.","While London has the highest median full-time salary in the UK at £34,069, workers living there have suffered a wage squeeze larger than other areas in the country.

A veteran of the Iraq war stole thousands of pounds from a children's football club and spent the money on a stag trip to Las Vegas.

David and Margaret-Ann Rous were on an Easter getaway when their private plane crashed into hills during bad weather in the Scottish highlands. The pair had arranged a secret visit using Mr Rous's light aircraft to see his wife's mother and sister on an island in the Inner Hebrides on Saturday. Newlyweds: Dr Margaret-Ann and David Rous died when their light aircraft crashed into a Scottish hillside while flying from their home in Dundee to make a surprise to see family on the the Hebridean isle of Tiree . Tragedy: The couple ‚ who had been married for less than a year ‚ were found in the wreckage of the aircraft . But when the couple failed to turn up at the island's airstrip and radar contact could not be made with the plane, a search party was scrambled. The wreckage of the plane and the couple's bodies were found in hills in Argyll six hours later as aviation experts said the flight may have encountered poor visibility. Shocked residents on the island of Tiree paid tribute to the 'wonderful' Dr Rous, 37, who had been married to the 28-year-old structural engineer for three years. The couple, who are understood to have been planning a family and to move into a larger property, can be seen revelling in married life in photographs posted online. Alongside images of their honeymoon in Venice, one poignant photograph, posted only months before the crash, shows the smiling couple wearing headsets in a plane cockpit. Dr Rous's sister Johann yesterday described the GP as her 'absolute rock', and said learning about the crash led to 'the hardest day of my life'. Dr Rous met her husband when he visited Tiree, where she grew up, several years ago. Lives cut short: It is understood the couple were moving to a larger house and were planning to start a family . The couple lived in a £260,000 semi-detached house in Newport-on-Tay, just across the river from Dundee where Dr Rous worked as a family doctor. Neighbours said that despite Mr Rous often working away from home, the couple frequently held parties for them to make friends. Dr John Holliday, Tiree's local doctor for almost 30 years, said: 'I had known Margaret-Ann since the 1980s. She captivated everyone that knew her. She was absolutely gorgeous in every way. She became a much-loved GP in Dundee and I have no doubt that she was a wonderful doctor with her charm and great empathy. Surprise visit to see family: The couple were flying in Mr Rous's Piper Cherokee from Dundee, where they lived, to Tiree, where Dr Rous grew up, to spend the weekend with her mother and sister . Scouring the landscape: A Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, a Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet and an air ambulance were all scrambled to make a search after radar contact with the plane was lost . 'She immediately touched the hearts of everyone who came into contact with her.' Paying tribute to Mr Rous, originally from Gillingham in Kent, he added: 'He was a really nice man and a very talented structural engineer with a bright professional career ahead of him. 'Together they made a fine couple. We can only imagine what the family must be suffering. 'A cloud has fallen over Tiree, but the island community will come together as it always does at times like this.' Private jet: The couple were flying in a Piper Cherokee light aircraft (like the one above) when tragedy struck . The tragedy unfolded after the couple set off from Dundee Airport in Mr Rous's single-engine Piper Cherokee plane on Saturday. Radar contact was lost at around 1.50pm as they travelled over the remote Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Coastguard and Royal Navy helicopters, as well as an air ambulance, were called, and found the wreckage at 8pm on the northern side of Glen Kinglass, above Loch Etive. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is now examining possible causes of the crash. Local aviation expert David Howitt said that the conditions were poor at the time, adding: 'I have been taking weather readings here for 50 years, and on Saturday the weather was very, very dubious.

In a Chicago appearance recently, the retired congressman had the sold-out crowd at the Center on Halsted well entertained as he detailed his 45-year journey in public service. Frank, you'll recall, was the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same-sex while in office, and among other things, he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against LGBT rights. And when someone in the audience asked his thoughts about a current ballot proposal in California that would legalize killing gay people, he said he wasn't aware of the measure but told the young man not to ""worry yourself about the crazy people."" ""We're winning,"" he said before joking that the name of the California proposal -- ""The Sodomite Suppression Act"" -- sounded like a porno. ""We're winning"" is a phrase I've heard a lot recently as it pertains to LGBT rights. And I guess if you look at where the country was 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the ""we"" that believes LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. Or at least not ""be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method"" as the California proposal suggests. (It's unclear whether Matt McLaughlin, the Huntington Beach lawyer who submitted the proposal, is being sincere or just an ass, but the fact remains that if he collects enough signatures there appears to be no legal way of stopping it from going on the ballot.) Frank's ""we're winning"" declaration was oddly timed, too. Less than 24 hours after his talk, the governor in the next state over signed an anti-LGBT ""religious freedom"" bill into the law -- one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation. ""Many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,"" Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said. Not to be outdone, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would sign a similar bill that is expected to reach his desk shortly. So we have: A fledgling proposal to kill the gays out West, laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland, and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful Ted Cruz is a barometer, a federal ban on same-sex marriage still on the GOP table. Like others, I had foolishly hoped the upcoming general election would be one defined by bold ideas. Instead, it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's ""cultural war"" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: ""We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women"" and later followed with ""There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America."" Progressives enjoyed poking fun at Cruz, the tea party darling when he announced his presidential bid, but according to the American Civil Liberties Union, ""the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment."" It's not just lawmakers. Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriage. And this week. a federal judge in Cruz's home state of Texas blocked a federal rule that would have granted married, same-sex couples access to the Family and Medical Leave Act, a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse. It seems clear that even if Cruz doesn't capture the GOP nomination, whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease LGBT rights backlash currently underway in conservative states. That could include one of Cruz's agenda items: a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, usurping whatever ruling comes out of the Supreme Court in June, when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected. And the NCAA can issue strongly worded statements, as it did over Indiana's new anti-LGBT law, and -- along with others in corporate America -- can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws. But at the end of the day, it's about votes. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, ""winning"" is going to feel very strange. Indeed, most 2016 hopefuls on the right have been reluctant to express support for same-sex marriage. According to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, ""it's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said, ""I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. (He later apologized) Gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Barney Frank said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. That may be true, but it's doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called ""religious freedom"" bills currently snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop -- especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Once again, our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two-party system. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate's policies before making a decision, but ultimately it may come down to a single-question: to discriminate against LGBT people or not. Unfortunately, the pending 2016 ""cultural war"" does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that. I know Frank and others have said ""we're winning"" but sitting here, watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory.",46,113,"law, legal, state, marriage, rights, laws, civil, federal, couples, petition,","campaign, clinton, governor, presidential, candidate, political, state, hillary, republican, candidates,","civil law, marriage, federal law, not legal, state law, petition, law for married couples","presidential campaign, presidential candidate, state governor, joining a presidential campaign, a huge impact on political campaigns","This topic is about civil law, marriage, federal law, legal actions, state law, petition, and law for married couples.","This topic is about the presidential campaign, the presidential candidate, a state governor, joining a presidential campaign, and a huge impact on political campaigns.","Despite Frank Barney's notion that ""we're winning,"" anti-LGBT laws are still being put into place across America.

The Madrid-based newspaper claim that Ancelotti is 'hesitating' between playing a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation as Gareth Bale and Luka Modric also look likely to miss Wednesday's clash. Marca lead with a similar line as the heap pressure on the Madrid boss by writing, 'Ancelotti searches for a Champions League Madrid without Modric, Bale...and almost surely without Benzema.'

The sale of halogen bulbs which are used in millions of homes could be banned as early as next year as part of the EU's energy-saving drive. It follows the prohibition of traditional incandescent bulbs, which have been phased out in an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of halogen bulbs are sold in Britain every year, often for use in kitchen and bathroom spotlights. Any ban could consequently cause enormous inconvenience. The European Commission and green campaigners say halogens are not much more efficient than traditional bulbs so should be replaced by energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs ‚ known as CFLs ‚ and LEDs. Yet these alternatives can be as much as 15 times more expensive. There is the additional problem that some LEDs do not work with the dimmer switches and wiring circuits currently used by halogen bulbs, while CFLs can take up to five minutes to reach full brightness. The EC is due to hold a vote on the issue in April, when it could agree to go ahead with the proposed 2016 ban or push back the date to 2018. Consumer group Which? argued there are good reasons for a delay. A spokesman said: 'Half of Which? members still have halogen bulbs in their home and more than two in five have halogen spotlights. Delaying the ban until 2018 would allow more time for some of the compatibility and user issues to be resolved.' And a campaign group of manufacturers called LightingEurope is demanding any ban on halogens is delayed until 2020 at the earliest, in order to minimise the impact on consumers and the industry. The group's secretary general, Diederik de Stoppelaar, said: 'A phase-out before 2020 is going to be costly and inconvenient to consumers. The industry supports the change to more energy efficient lighting... however, an earlier date does not allow for alternative developing technologies to be widely available.' But Which? added that despite the inconvenience, there are some positives to switching. The new bulbs last longer and, because they are more energy efficient, they will cut electricity bills over time. Typically, halogens use 10 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs, while CFLs use 60-80 per cent less and LEDs up to 90 per cent less. LED lights are so efficient that a 5-watt bulb is, in theory, equivalent to a 35-watt halogen. But while a typical 35-watt halogen spotlight costs about £1, a 5-watt LED can be anything from £5 to £15. The managing director of British lighting company BLT Direct, Steven Ellwood, supports the 2016 ban. He said: 'We understand the concerns of experts who want to delay the ban in order to iron out some issues.

591,DZE04HFYCPF91R6UBJ12ILK7JT6HOL,eea7e4efb8df6694e7e8efcd5c5285d470bff992,"(CNN)They were not-so-affectionately dubbed the ""bed-wetters"" by then-Obama senior adviser David Plouffe. The definition: Democrats who run to the hills every time there's a bump in the road. The Chicken Littles. The woe-is-us crowd. Well, they're at it again. Not surprisingly, it's because of the Hillary Clinton email brouhaha, an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world. And the home team stands in place, just watching, somewhat stunned. But Democrats don't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out. Hillary Clinton is their candidate; their putative nominee. ""Their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible,"" says one senior Democratic strategist. ""And from time to time, this may require an intervention."" Now might be a good time. But while the anxious Democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs ‚î and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup ‚î they might do well to look at themselves. Over the past six years, there's been a sharp structural decline of elected Democrats everywhere below the presidential level. Sure, we all know about how the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2014, but what about the fact that blue-state governors fell like tent poles? Or that GOP governors now outnumber the Democrats by almost two-to-one, 31 to 18. Or that Republicans have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the Democrats, 30 to 11. And down the ballot, Democrats under Obama have lost more than 900 state legislative seats: the worst showing of any modern president. That's eye-popping. So, the conventional judgment that the Clinton behemoth is just too big ‚î too well funded, too well supported, too historic ‚î all helps account for the paucity of alternatives, to be sure. But there's much, much more to it than the phenom of Bigfoot Hillary. It's the phenom of Barack Obama, too ‚î and the very strong counterforces he's generated around the country. The gains at the presidential level have not been cost-free: The country is polarized, the Democrats are often on defense and they're losing ground. One result: a thin presidential bench, which is painfully evident. Clinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know . And if you take a peek at those blue-state governors who might be president, consider this: At 76, Jerry Brown, an able leader, is probably past his sell-by date for a presidential bid. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made very few moves to raise his national profile. And Democratic governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland. Any time you have Republicans winning the gubernatorial races in Massachusetts, Illinois and Maryland, Democrats should pay attention. As has been the case with other presidents, for Obama party-building has not been on top of the agenda. But it shows. And so when Hillary Clinton runs into some trouble, the Democrats ought to worry. The Republicans have a deep and varied field; the Democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate. Speaking of Hillary Clinton, part of the problem right now is situational. Those Democrats who want to defend her say there's a problem -- they're not quite sure what they're defending, because they're not sure exactly what happened, or why. In other words, the wagons are circled, but the surrogates are left outside. Next, while Team Clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy (Why not let the GOP battle it out? No need to give the GOP early target practice?), the downside is now obvious: How do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond? If you're out there making personal appearances, it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room. No matter how much you tweet about it. Clinton's stumbles fuel Democratic critics . Bottom line, there is no organized pushback and there is no Plan B. (OK, Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders, we know who you are, and that you're probably running, but still.) Or at least no Big Plan B. The pre-presidential league on the Democratic side is not exactly overflowing with big-time candidates. (Unless you think Vice President Joe Biden is running or Secretary of State John Kerry is running, which they likely are not. Same for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.) So ""bed-wetters,"" beware. The truth is simple: Your job is to defend Hillary Clinton, not to bury her. Yes, it can be hard. Even annoying.

The research discovered that just under a third (31 per cent) of the parents underestimated where their child's body mass index (BMI) was on obesity scale. The scale  classifies children as very overweight (or obese), overweight, a healthy weight, or underweight. Many parents are afflicted by 'weight blindness', and are unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese, according to new research (file picture) Just four parents described their child as being very overweight despite 369 children being officially identified as such (1 per cent) and fewer than 1 per cent overestimated their child's weight status. According to official guidelines, children are classified as overweight at the 85th centile and very overweight (or obese) at the 95th centile. The team estimated that for a child with a BMI at the 98th centile there was an 80 per cent chance that the parent would classify their child as a healthy weight. Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum and chair of the Child Growth Forum said: 'Because there are so many overweight and obese children around, the parents are in denial. 'They say ""my Jonny is no fatter than the child down the road"". 'My advice would be that if any parent is concerned about their child's weight, they should take the child to the doctor or chemist. 'Think of an excuse to go down. Have the doctor or chemist take the BMI. 'When they have the result they can reassure the parent, or give them advice on whether the child's weight is too high. 'BMI is a very good measure, but it needs input from a health professional who can look at the child holistically and judge whether there is a problem or not. 'Parents will not be able to measure their child accurately as they won't have the correct measurements for height and for weight bathroom scales are notoriously inaccurate. 'They need to be properly measured by a professional who can make a proper judgement and give proper advice. 'You cannot tell if a child is overweight or obese on one measure. 'You need to look at the child's BMI and ideally plot this against their BMI three months ago.' However, they recognised that parents became more likely to classify their child as overweight when the child had a BMI above the 99.7th centile. The study found that parents were more likely to underestimate their child's weight if they were black or south Asian, from more deprived backgrounds, or if the child was male. Researchers suggested that if parents cannot identify when their child is overweight, this throws into question the effectiveness of public health campaigns aiming to address obesity in the home. Recent research found that a third of children in England are now classed as overweight or obese. Parents might underestimate their children's weight due to be fear of being judged, unwillingness to label a child as overweight, and shifting perceptions of normal weight because of increases in body weight in general. They said evidence suggests that parents who recognise their child's weight on the BMI chart are more likely to perceive potential health risks. The study was led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and UCL Institute of Child Health. It involved questioning the parents of 2,976 children in five primary care trusts: Redbridge, Islington, West Essex, Bath and North East Somerset, and Sandwell. The team said the research could help evaluate how effective public health interventions for obesity in children are likely to be in different groups of the population. Senior author Dr Sanjay Kinra, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'If parents are unable to accurately classify their own child's weight, they may not be willing or motivated to enact the changes to the child's environment that promote healthy weight maintenance.' Co-author Professor Russell Viner, of the UCL institute of Child Health, said: 'Measures that decrease the gap between parental perceptions of child weight status and obesity scales used by medical professionals may now be needed in order to help parents better understand the health risks associated with overweight and increase uptake of healthier lifestyles.' Graph, from the US' Centres for Disease Control and Prevention,shows how an a 10 year old boy would be considered healthy, underweight, healthy, overweight or obese depending on which percentile they are in on the BMI chart. A 10 year old with a BMI of 23 would be in the obese category (95th percentile or greater) The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice. Amanda McLean, director of the World Cancer Research Fund, said: 'By encouraging children to eat healthily, maintain a healthy weight, and be regularly physically active, parents can help children develop healthy habits and protect against health problems later in life. 'We know that obesity is linked to a range of health risks later in life ‚ including increased cancer risk ‚ so it's vital that parents are aware of their child's Body Mass Index (BMI), and can spot if their youngster is starting to become overweight. 'But we also need to acknowledge that more can, and should, be done to encourage healthy eating and greater physical activity in our society. We need targeted policies that help people lead healthy lives ‚ from clearer nutritional labelling to a focus on health education in schools. 'By encouraging good habits we can help future generations lead happy, healthy, lives.'

The offence saw 36-year-old, Karma Elms scam the Health department out of $39,352 over 15 months. According to the Magistrate, Elms showed a 'degree of defensiveness' despite pleading guilty and made note of the fact that she had travel a long way to get to work. She has not yet repaid the debt and is on the brink of bankruptcy after spending all of the stolen funds on credit cards, rent and gift hampers. 'Clearly you are a poor manager of your personal finances and have spent money that far exceeded your income,' The ABC reported Magistrate Cull said. Elms was hired by Queensland health in 2010 to help with the large workload after the department's flawed payroll system was introduced that left 1800 employees with little or no pay.

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained . A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, ""See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.""' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education. The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda . City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings . 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference. Ledbetter said school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on a parent-teacher meeting. 'See, Obama is a baby killer.
